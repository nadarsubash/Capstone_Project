1,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Hi everyone. I am 25 years old married with a 6 month old son. I was diagnosed with severe ADHD at the age of about 10...I'm talking horrible behavior, bad grades, constant moving, etc. my mother told the doctors no medicine at that age. Then around 12 my mother caved in and gave me the adderall, I hated bc of the instant side effects for me. I continued to take it until about 14 and I made a 100% improvement. At 14 I learned to cope with the ADHD on my own. But now 11 years later in the real world with many stresses, my ADHD had gotten worse then ever, to the point that my wife wanted to leave me because she couldn't handle it. I got my prescription back and my life is amazing.. 30mg IR 3x a day 1 in a.m 1 after lunch 1 on way home from work.""",10,
2,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I'm a 31yr old female, 5'4, 115lbs. I was 1st prescribed adderall in 2012, so I've taken it about 3 1/2 yrs. within that time there's ben a few situations that forced me 2 go with out meds for a week or more, which reminded me how much it helps! Without it I could sleep 18hrs for days & still be wanting 2 sleep an hr or so after getting up! I can sleep while taking it, but don't have the strong compulsion to. The first day taking it I've learned 2 only take half bc if not it feels like I'm on cocaine, even after just a week of not having it. But the 2nd day & thereafter is fine.I never experiencd any ""comedown"" like some ppl. The only negative is without it I get agitated easily & get on my own nerves when it comes 2 lack of concentration, forgetfulness,n sleeping 2 much.""",9,
3,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""This drug was prescribed to after ritilin didn't work well. This medication helped my ADHD but the side affects were unbearable. Cotton mouth, irritability, anxiety, panic attacks. I seemed like the cons outweighed the pros. Much more successful than ritilin but not enough. My doctor decided to try Vyvanse, a new version of adderall with less side effects and better outcomes for treatment plus no crash after dinner """,7,
4,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""My face breaks out in itchy blotchy spots and I never sleep""",7,
5,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Adderall has improved my life drastically! So drastically that I had to come on here and write about it. Since I have ADHD, simple tasks can be very hard for me. I'm 19 and just started working at a store and before being on it I was having trouble following directions and a manager even told me I needed extra training. Anyway, I managed to do well enough to not be asked to leave. Now that I'm on it I think my managers are sort of shocked at how productive I am. So much that the store manager even came up to me and said the other managers have told her that I've improved so much and become a very hard worker. On my last 2 anatomy exams I got a B. I'm able to focus and do things without giving up so easily.""",10,
6,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I was once a procrastinating, underemployed, muscular 18 year old who was unsure of his future. My ADHD made it impossible to focus, my motivation was terrible, and I snapped on anyone over the smallest thing. I knew about Ritalin...also knew its excess side effects. Heard about Adderall and decided maybe I should speak with my PCF. He prescribed me Adderal, a pill that can either make or break you. If you have had ANY history of drug abuse AVOID IT. It took me a month to realize I was abusing it. I lost sleep, weight, gained a tolerance. When I decided I'd better let my wife handle my medication, she gave me my two IRs per day and still does. It helped alot. The medication is wonderful for ADHD but can very easily kill you if you abuse it""",8,
7,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I do not like taking medicine but had extreme anxiety and trouble paying attention before. I wish I took this before been a few days and more so much more focused. I haven't misplaced phone or car keys""",10,
8,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I have been using Adderall for about 2 years now. I am an adult male at the age of 25. I always had an issue focusing in school and I have had a ""rocking"" issue my entire life. I tend to rock back and forth while reading or sitting about. It was very difficult to complete homework because I would try to figure out the answers to my homework problems but my rocking would take all of my focus and no matter how hard I tried to stop the rocking, I would always end up doing it anyway. As I attended college I was put on academic probation and decided to see a Doctor. Since I have been diagnosed and prescribed Adderall, my life has changed 100% for the better. No more rocking and my focus is incredible!""",10,
9,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Good with increased mental focus and less distractions by activities that were going on around me. I have nothing negative to say about the Adderall. It has improved my ability to control my attention and give me greater intensity in thinking and reasoning.""",10,
10,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Adderall has totally brought my life into focus. I started taking it about 6 months ago I'm 39 now and really wish I had this medicine as a kid. In addition to ADD I had severe anxiety and depression as a child/teenager. Adderall has given me focus, lifted my general mood, taken my anxiety away and made me a productive human being. I'm actually starting my own business! The only bad thing is that you really have to be careful of how much you take because it can have the opposite effect i.e. severe anxiety and no focus but if you take it the right way it will change your life! One other bad thing is the stigma surrounding the medicine and being treated like an addict by some pharmacists.""",9,
11,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""It makes you feel very energetic and makes you want to accomplish everything and it makes you very interested in stuff going on with yourself. It keeps you awake and very alert and you feel like you are on top of the world.""",9,
12,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I knew I was different when I went to school. Being an only child I was very loved and cared for. I lived for the attention in kindergarten I knew I was not like everyone else it took me longer to learn things than others I wouldn't listen fully to instructions. I was so eager to please I fell over myself trying to prove things to be accepted I was outgoing and a class clown my mother always got notes home about me things like she doesn't sit still gets out of her seat talk talk talk I'm grown and my mother has passed away. My best friend therapist has shown me PTSD and ADHD, now I know who I am now.""",10,
13,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""This pill definitely keeps me focused.""",10,
14,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Took XR but IR is a little heavy for me. Now I split my meds in half 5mg 2-3 times a day. Duration seems better than XR. I take lamictal as well. IR helps me get more done but I don't feel personally that the good outweigh the bad. I have reached a norm. Weight. I eat healthier I look healthier. And I take better care of my body. At first - dry skin slightly, hyper focused (my body did not know how to react) I smelT AWFUL at first! Haha I sweat it out ew! I can't find this side effect anywhere. It can take a toll if you don't take care of your body. Stay healthy.""",9,
15,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I was 23 when I was diagnosed with ADHD. Started Adderall, I take 30 mg of SR a day and the difference is phenomenal! I get up with ease because I know I can tackle all tasks with astounding motivation and actually enjoy doing tedious work. I am co-morbid with anxiety, rumination, and I was highly neurotic. I found myself aggressive, quick tempered, and easily abusing marijuana and alcohol. This all changed with Adderall, I am rational, reflect on situations in a positive light, and generally just a more helpful and kind person. Adderall completely saved my professional and personal life. Side note, it can cause erectile dysfunction but it will go away after your body is used to the cycle.""",10,
16,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""It works but I think it might be the effect from having extra energy so you do more things. It definitely helps with motivation and depression. Ironically it got rid of my anxiety as well.""",7,
17,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I have been taking Adderall for two years and it has probably saved my life. I had been misdiagnosed as bi-polar with no co-morbid ADHD, and was prescribed benzodiazepines and anti-depressants. I eventually became suicidal when Abilify was added,and was lucky enough to have a moment of clarity and changed doctors and hospital affiliates. The week I was started on ADHD meds, I started to become the person I should be. I only wish I could have been diagnosed as a child, I feel I missed half my education. I can now focus all day, keep a train of thought long enough to finish mundane to complex tasks, and have written and recorded an album of music that had been completed but in disarray. No side effects, no weight loss or changes in eating habits.""",10,
18,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Adderall has been a blessing to me. I take 30mg twice a day and my thinking has become so much more clear. I am now able to pay attention and absorb what is going on around me. I have had no negative side effects except for an occasional night where it might take me an extra 30 minutes to fall asleep. I still have a healthy appetite since taking Adderall. This medicine has made my life so much better.""",9,
19,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I have ran the gauntlet of ADD meds, starting with Concerta then tried Vyvance which worked well in the beginning, then my Dr switched to Adderall XR, then to I R, which works best for me I take 20mg twice a day definitely helps with non stop thinking, racing thoughts, and just simply getting motivated. I have been on the IR for about a year and the highs are finally outweighing the lows. 39 years old and can see light at the end of the tunnel.""",9,
20,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 yrs old and pretty much just learned to deal with it until age 14. When I started 8th grade, my parents put me on the meds and I absolutely love it! I'm so much more successful! Plus I feel better about myself as a person. I don't know how I went all those years without it. Its definitely made my life better.""",10,
21,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""When I was diagnosed with ADHD in the 3rd grade they put me on Adderall and then I became a person I was not. I had social anxiety but got exceptionally good grades in school where others failed. Adderall changes your personality and was the worst 12 years of my life, I had no friends because engaging in conversation was nearly impossible. It traps your thoughts in a prison of your mind and suppresses any creativity. """,1,
22,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I always knew I was different from everyone else. I was very quiet and shy. But in my mind I couldn't shut up. My mind was loud. In class I could never stop fidgeting, playing with my hair, scratching an itch, doodling on notebooks. I wondered why nobody else squirmed around like me. At 24 I was diagnosed with ADD. Adderall is life changing. I'm finally normal. I feel like everyone else. My mind is at ease. I am in charge of my thoughts. I can have genuine conversations with people without my mind wondering. I am finally happy after years of struggles. I am organized and more peaceful. """,10,
23,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Very effective in treating ADHD.""",10,
24,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I've taken Adderall for 2 years. The first 6 months, worked very well. Balanced me out, kept me focused & side effects were minimal. But, the efficiency of Adderall has really gone down in my experience. I often find myself hyper focusing on things I don't need to & the side effects have gotten much worse. Insomnia, horrible dry mouth (= more cavities), I get antsy & shaky at times & I also feel I've become dependent on it. Next doctors appointment, I will be asking to switch out to something else. Its a good medicine at first, but understand that many of the great reviews are likely written by newer Adderall users.""",6,
25,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I liked how focused it made me however if I was agitated it made it worse""",6,
26,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Hyper focused, dry mouth. Both this and Straterra put me into state of manic. Used Depakote 750mg for mental balance. """,4,
27,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I've taken Vyvanse extended release and Adderall extended release. I didn't like the mood swings and irritability I suffered when they would wear off. My doctor has since put me on Adderall immediate release 30 milligram tablets twice a day. I've taken these tablets for 2 years now and love that I can focus and I am not having mood swings or irritable at all. I have experienced dry mouth and some jitters as well as trouble sleeping. I take Ambien to sleep and it is no longer an issue. I have to take a vitamin supplement due to a huge weight loss though. I was over weight when I started Adderall and now am at a healthy weight and maintaining that weight without issue.""",10,
28,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""After 37 years of knowing something wasn't right with my brain, I was diagnosed with ADHD, Inattentive Type in grad school and was prescribed Adderall. Where do I start??? This medication literally changed my life. Imagine being a ""gifted"" kid who eventually could barely pass middle school math - that's me. After a lifetime of compensating for my ""slow processing,"" hiding my disorganization, and pretending to be on the same page with everyone else, this explains everything. Adderall has made a NIGHT AND DAY difference in my motivation level, what I understand and follow, and even my mood/emotional reactivity. In a word, amazing. If I ever meet the people who ""discovered"" Adderall, I'm kissing them - my husband agrees.""",10,
29,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Finally I was diagnosed with ADD as an adult after struggling my whole life with ADD. I was put on Adderall and my life changed 100% for the better. I think this is a wonderful medication for those with ADD!""",10,
30,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I'm a 57 year old male that has been clean and in recovery for ten years now. I have abstained from anything stronger than aspirin the whole time. Chronic pain had made it necessary to begin a closely monitored treatment schedule, but I was still losing a lot of focus on tasks at work and any motivation for anything but sleeping at home. After talking to the doctor we added 20mg Adderal 3 times a day. The difference has been amazing. I normally work pretty long hours and had been having trouble staying awake in the morning going to work and evenings going home. No more. Properly scheduling the doses keeps me active and focused my entire day. Didn't take long to find out that it increased energy and desire in other areas also. All others.""",10,
31,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I am prescribed Adderall XRs. I am only on 30 mg once a day and my Dr won't increase it. The medication definitely makes me motivated, have energy, and feel a nice since of well-being. I am concerned with a few side effects I get almost every time. I get numb on the left side of my neck and in my shoulder. I also get really cold feet and my toes look purple with very slow capillary refill. I also already had a sleep problem before all this, so my nights are always pretty restless.""",7,
32,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Great medication. I was doing tasks again and talking to people again. The only down side is I want something more 24hrs. The instant release tabs had peaks and after the peaks I would have massive anxiety and the same was with the extended release. It's a great medicine but not for me.""",9,
33,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""This is a great medicine for focus but it has a downside to it as well. It can cause chest pains. So you must be careful with usage. """,9,
34,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Adderall in my opinion is a ""Miracle""! I am prescribed the (IR) 30mg strength, three times a day. Adderall I feel has significantly improved my quality of life.""",9,
35,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I am almost 50 yr old female just, diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. In elementary school super bright but would finish my work quickly and disrupt the rest of the class. I was never considered hyper just a little ""naughty"" and disrupted. Now looking back as things in my life have become more disruptive as I age. Couldn't hold a job lately, drink too much etc. I have the Adderral now and that's great. However, when I read about it not working or it becomes less effective, I get nervous because I don't want to be that disruptive unemployable person. I met a Doctor who has ADD as well. He found that simple blood hormone test and restoring your levels can assist in using less medication, making the medication more effective and less side effects.""",10,

39,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I too have gone through my whole life with undiagnosed ADHD and I have to say that I have lost so many years of my life both academically and personal. I've been recently diagnosed with ADHD and started Ritalin. I could not tolerate Ritalin. It made me feel like a zombie along with bad headaches. My MD switched me to Adderall and It has changed my life. I wish I would have sought help years ago but I was too embarrassed to seek mental health help. I've been on 30 mg per day of Adderall for 1.5 months now and its worked great except that I think this dose is too low as I have to split the 30 mg into two doses per day. 20 mg works great for me but the other 10 mg I have to take doesn't do much for me.""",10,
40,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""Adderall is effective, but it comes with consequences. Both to your physical and mental health. I am 27 years old, I have taken Adderall on and off for about 10 years. Started it my freshman year of college. It was AMAZING at first! Lost that freshman 15, got straight A's, actually ENJOYED my work. Then I started noticing the crash symptoms. Tired, withdrawn, emotionless, sleepless. I stopped taking it because I hated the way it made me feel, but I realized how much more productive I am when taking it. When I start taking it again my immune system is shot, I'm constantly sick with something, I get super irritable. When I don't take it I can barely get out of bed and I always gain weight, which always sucks. It's a vicious cycle.""",6,

Forgetting what I was talking about mid sentence, going into a room forgetting what I was there for. All in all though, I call this medicine a miracle. I hate thinking about how much of my life I've missed out on before this. I was in school to be a Pharmacy Tech. I dropped out within a month, because I just couldn't keep up, or focus. I feel good now. My insurance at first weren't filling it. My doctor had to call the insurance co, they approved it for a year. My doctors appointment to check how this medicine dosage is working. I think I need to go up a bit. I don't have annoying side effects""",10,
42,Adderall,1,amphetamine and dextroamphetamine,"""I floated through high school, got honors and graduated a year early. Did the same through a state college, even though I was accepted to Ivy leagues with scholarships. I chose the easy route as I hated books, and never read anything, despite being able to pass with a bachelors in college and honors in HS just on auditory lecture learning, I was scared to challenge myself. Went to nursing school 10 years ago and failed out. Then I tried again on Adderall - Out of a class of 140, I'm #1. Everything I read I absorb. I can NOW focus. Everything's wired tight and each day I am limitless on what I can learn. I feel music. I'm in touch with everything. I thank everyday I'm on it.""",10,

I don't think I would have made it through high school or college without it. I started when I was 14 and starting high school. I loathed getting up early, but shortly after taking my pills I was awake and motivated to get ready and go about my day. It made boring classes seem more interesting. It gives you this focus and drive to be productive.I don't feel like myself without them. I'm cranky, unmotivated, eat and sleep a lot if I don't take it. Just be cautious with dosage. You do develop a tolerance to it over time. If your blood pressure goes way up and you feel jittery or shaky, your taking too high of a mg. People should start with 10 or 20mg at first.""",10,

Just started 40mg daily and I feel the therapeutic effect. Profound concentration at work, desire to tweak processes, love getting things done, a non-stop interest in being productive with everything.

If you don't have an addictive personality, you won't be addicted to it. I have to say it works really well with my ADD. I'm able to study for hours at a time. I don't necessarily think it makes you smarter. It just lets you focus on a task without getting distracted. I think my only complaint is sudden mood swings and agitation.

I'm prescribed 60mg a day, and that used to be great, but now if I take more than 30 mg my sleep quality suffers to the point where I'm a zombie the next day.

In college the situation was getting worse, and I started to get depressed about my bad grades. I then realized my depression was stemming from my inability to concentrate on school work.

I have noticed a decrease in appetite but it seems more like a newly developed aversion to high calorie foods and I'm wondering if that's not because of the added stimulation from the carbohydrates. Either way I think it's important for everyone to remember there is no magic pill and in order to get the best results you have to change your lifestyle too.

I am 21 years old and I am on 54mg AND I take a side-effect medication called INTUNIV XR (2mg) that cured the anxiety side-effect which I found to come about half way through the day and when the Concerta was wearing off.

I can tell a difference (not huge) on the weekend days he doesn't take it. Or if he didnt sleep well the night before and when it begins to wear off in the evening he tends to be a little grouchy.

Sure I experience some side effects, but I've learned to manage them over the years (force myself to eat etc).

However over the past year or so I have been experiencing negative side effects such as depression, headaches, and loss of appetite.

If I give in to my weakness, I will slump on the couch and think about all the things I need to do. I never fully rest mentally, though it alleviates some of the hyperactivity.

Please excuse the lengthy review I just know the search can be tough and long. I have Depression, ADD, GA & SA, and OCD skin(cuticle) picking tendencies. It's been very hard finding a stimulant that didn't worsen my anxiety related symptoms. I could tolerate 5mg adderrall XR but my body burned through both the XR and IR in about 3 hours. Then I would crash for the rest of the day (depressed, irritable, anxious). Vyvanse gave me zero motivation and made me calm but in a weird way. For example, I didn't care or worry about anything... I didn't even want to talk to people. I would just want to sit there alone and stare at a wall or something. It was nice to be that relax but too weird. But the real problem was the crash! It was the most extreme of all the stimulants I've tried by far! I took it only twice and threw it out. I almost didn't try Daytrana patch because Ritalin was actually the first stimulant I tried, which was over 10 years ago and I remember similar symptoms to that I had on adderrall. I ended up giving it a try with the logic that it might be smoother since its was for children and I was also desperate since I'm working and study for the GRE. I'm so happy I gave Daytrana a shot!! I'm telling you if you suffer from anxiety, can't tolerate the crashes, and metabolize the other stimulant too fast you have got to try this one!! I've only been on it for a week but I can't believe it! I leave it in for the whole 9 hours and I never crash. In comparison to Adderall is still the best stimulant for getting you motivated, I have to motivate myself a little but unlike adderall I can stay focused ALL day with Daytrana. Im also less likely to do something ""stimulanty"" like start reorganizing my closet for no reason but I do get the necessary cleaning, errands, bills etc done effortlessly. And the best part is that it doubles as an anti-depressant since, what I assume is the increased dopamine stays in my system pretty much all day and night. The ""happiness"" doesn't feel like a high it feels more like an absence of depression. I don't have anymore of the repetitive negative thoughts. The constant emotions of hopelessness, guilt, embarrassment, you name it, just aren't there anymore. There is still a mild degree of sadness I carry with me but I have major depression so I feel like it's only normal and I can handle that :)!! As far as the negative side effects: Like all the stimulants I've been on I still have the insomnia, loss of appetite, and increase urge to pick at my cuticles at night when it's wearing off. But there is not a ""crash"". no evenings being completely drained of energy, fits of irritation, major anxiety or depression. Also, the patch is applied to your hip and I'm experiencing some muscle tension in my legs which I think might be slowly subsiding. Im drinking a lot of water and taking vitamins in precaution of cramps. Advice on taking the patch off- It's easier for me to take it off when it's wet.

She wears them 16 or more hours if she has a date, or there is a school function that lasts late e.g. PROM.

Impulses have been reduced also;,9,
589,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I would have to say wow! It helped me focus during school. I used to be an average student, now I have straight A's. and I don't have a problem getting anything done;",9,
590,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I love this. I've started taking it 3 years ago, it's effective for me. The best thing about this pills it makes me less-hungry, and it help me lose weight!;",10,
591,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I have been using Ritalin 10mg for the past 3 weeks now. I am 28 years old and i suspected for a long time now that I have ADHD. Not being able to concentrate or focus, prioritise tasks and having depression (i am not taking medication for this) caused a lot of anxiety for me over the past 4-5 years. Ritalin has helped alot with my studies and kind of calms me. I am pretty quiet when i take it also. Its great for if you need to use it for work or study , but for everyday use I wouldn't like it. - In the first 45mins it gives me a slight euphoric feeling. - Makes me want to do productive activities. - Causes slight headaches if i don't drink plenty of water. I would recommend it. (I have tried adderall in the USA and that was even better);",7,
592,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"It helps, but not for very long. But it definitely doesn't make me as irritable as other ADHD medications;",8,
593,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"My son has been taking Ritalin for around 6-8 months and the difference in him is just unbelievable, he's school work has improved, he's spelling and comprehension has gotten a lot better and he has excelled in maths and can actually remembers what he has learnt. He socially gets along better with other children and is less destructive when in a group setting. I was very hesitant to put my son on meds but now realise I made the best choice for him.;",10,
594,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"This medicine is incredible. I've had ADD for about 20 years, as long as I've been alive and college has exacerbated the condition, so my neurologist prescribed Ritalin to me. This starts to wear off after about 2.5-3.0 hours, but it works absolute MIRACLES. The whole time before, whenever I tried to work, it was like I was seeing the world through warped glasses and my mind was just foggy, like it was full of ice and cotton, but now the entire world is beautifully, wonderfully clear! This is truly an amazing medicine, but be sure to follow your doctor's orders with it, as it can have side effects.;",10,
595,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I'm in my mid 30's & was diagnosed with ADHD approx 4 months ago. I started on 10 mg 2x a day & am currently on 20 mg 3 x a day. I tried Daytrana, the Ritalin patch, but it made me aggressive & hungry! In less than a month I had gained 20 lbs. I'm back on the pill & so far I love it! I wish I had this back in school! Unfortunately my mom wasn't a believer in ADHD. I am calmer, can think rationally vs going straight off emotions, the racing thoughts have ceased & I can complete tasks I start now. It's also given me more motivation in my life. Before Ritalin I was ready to give up on life & did nothing. I can now take care of responsibilities! My mood has even improved & my patience with my children & people in General has vastly improved.;",9,
596,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"What can I say, dx with mild ADD too (who isn't anymore) But this taken with Effexor XR has helped very much with apathy, motivation, energy and enjoyment of life! Dr.'s reluctantly Rx this bc it is Schedule 2 substance and is mostly Rx'd for ADD/ADHD but it has a profound effect in boosting the effects of an antidepressant. Taken alone for depression? Not really a good idea bc it wears off fast. I take 20-30 mg a day (TID);",8,
597,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,Have to say wow! It helps low energy depression and works well with most SSRIs and some low dose SNRIs. Life feels exciting again and it offsets SSRI sexual side effects. Works fast and well. Main problem is that it wears off in a few hours so you need to dose multiple times a day. It causes you to sweat a little more and be a little more irritable than usual but it is really a great med to help depression. It is much different and better than Wellbutrin for sure even though both are NDRI's. Check out the research on stimulants for depression and bipolar depression. Going to try Provigil now for a more even energy/mood boost. But I may be back to this.;,9,
598,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I've been taking it for 7 years and it turned my life around. I am severely dyslexic and have ADD and am on 30mg to 40mg a day. However, as of recent it has started making me slightly disorientated and even slightly sleepy, and my thoughts come faster than I speak (used to happen before I started taking Ritalin with my dyslexia) but it feels worse. I just started interning at an Ad company so not the best of times! ;",8,
599,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,I had taken every form of Ritalin while in elementary and junior high school it helped me focus but I felt like a zombie and my mom always felt like it was not really me. I was always angry when I would start to come down from it at night so in high school I started taking Aderrall and it was such a great change.;,5,
600,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I find Ritalin allows me to focus. With my ADD and bipolar I couldn't even read a book. My doctor says though its a stimulant, Ritalin tends not to push bipolars into mania. I was self medicating my ADD with caffeine which made me anxious so I'm glad the Ritalin replaces that. I'm on a low dose now and hope to increase to where the positive effects last longer, as they are short lived now.;",10,
601,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I have been taking Ritalin for about a month now. It really helps me focus on things. But a downfall is, it is really hard to multi-task. I can only concentrate on one thing at a time, and that makes it very difficult for my school work. Also, I have had a huge loss in appetite. I am not hungry, EVER. During the month I have been on this medicine I have lost almost twenty pounds due to the fact that I never want to eat.;",6,
602,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,I have been on Ritalin for 5 months now and it works great for my ADHD. I wish I would have been on it when I was in high school maybe I would have finished high school. I am 25 yrs old and I'm going for my G.E.D so I can go to College. I am so happy now I can concentrate and do things that I was never able to do. The only con is that it is not lasting as long as it did when I first got on it. I really believe Ritalin saved my life.;,9,
603,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I'm 28 yrs old and just started taking this 2 months ago. I abused med's in my teens & for the past 6 yrs have turned down prescriptions for fear of addiction & losing my personality and control. I gave Ritalin a shot at 10mg 2/day, 5 day/week none on weekends. I wish my parents would have taken me to a doctor to get checked out about 20 years ago. In 2 months I have been able to focus and concentrate on things like never before. I went from being an average student and poor test taker to above average and testing well. I don't snap at people as much as I did prior to taking. And still feel in control of who I am. The down side is I had to cut back on my coffee consumption. Its a good cause!;",9,
604,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I'm currently going through nursing school at a university near me and from the start of this past semester I had a real tough time staying focused and doing my homework. Went to see a nurse APR N and she gave me a script for Ritalin, 10mg 2x a day. This medicine has been a God send for me, I always complete my assignments on time and have been getting A's and B's on all my test. It lets me sit down and study for 6 hours at a time but if I hadn't taken the Ritalin I wouldn't have half the work done that needed to be done. Plus I've not had a single issue with it such as withdrawals or anxiety.;",9,
605,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,This medicine made me feel zombie like. I had hopes of focus and alertness and I know achieving the level of focus intended for the medicine does take a couple of weeks to take effect. But I do not think I can tolerate the restlessness feeling to achieve the intended effect. Just my opinion.;,5,
606,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,Before Ritalin I was constantly snapping at my husband and I was never able to concentrate at work. After taking it I have turned into a new person! I am able to relax and for once feel calm. My husband said that since I started taking it I haven't been as moody. I am also able to complete my work projects in a timely manner.;,9,
607,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I am a 20 year old man, going to university and had or still have troubles concentrating with my ADHD, mostly staying on one subject. Started taking Dexedrine, first it made me restless and gave lots of anxiety. Could not hold up a normal conversation or sit still, it made me feel uncomfortable. Then tried Concerta it was effective somewhat but did not help as much as I had hoped, could not notice much of a effect. Ritalin gives me the concentration when I need it most. ;",7,
608,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I was 31 years old before I began taking Ritalin. I take a small dose, 10mg in the morning and 10mg early afternoon. I wish I had been prescribed this medicine years ago. I drive a truck for a living but I also do a lot of self study (audio and printed books) and Ritalin has greatly increased my productivity with the latter and safety with the former. I experience VERY few side effects. My mind used to wander quite often, I just thought I had an active imagination, but it was a problem. I have not lost my ability to imagine or abstract yet I have lost of tendency to wander aimlessly into unrelated thought. I have also lost my ability to get lost so often while driving!;",10,
609,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I found Ritalin increased my alertness and concentration. I rate Ritalin 2/10 as I find it increased my depression, from which point I stopped taking. Unsure whether the Ritalin interacted negatively with my usual small dose antidepressant Cymbalta or if increased depression is an unreported side effect.;",2,
610,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I have severe ADHD . For a while I didn't know what was wrong with me, constantly day dreaming,lazy, unorganized, acting impulsively and very hyper. The medicine has changed my life. All these symptoms are gone except I'm still a bit hyper and impulsive but only slightly. It does exactly what it says on the tin and changed my life dramatically. I could actually focus. Bad things would be if you are sensitive to stimulants like coffee. It will make you jittery, it gives you a slight mood and energy boost. I'd recommend taking it in small doses first. ;",10,
611,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I've been taking Ritalin (extended release) at 20mg for almost a year now. I take it for ADHD. (I also have bipolar disorder type I.) This medication doesn't help with me when it comes to being hyper and full of energy all the time, but it does help with concentration. The only side effect I have experienced so far is loss of appetite, but not significantly.;",8,
612,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"Ritalin made me able to block out everything and focus on reading my boring, tedious nursing books. Take it at least 12 hours before you go to sleep, or else it will keep you up at night with thoughts racing. It suppresses appetite and makes most people lose weight- I actually gained weight because I would be starving and binge eat at the end of the night. I did like Ritalin, but it made me too irritable so I switched to Adderall. That is much more pleasant and even more effective. Focalin 10 mg is good for people with mild ADHD symptoms. ;",8,
613,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD last week he has always been super hyper, climbs on furniture, spins, sticks tongue out and can't look anyone in the eyes without fidgeting around. I didn't want to believe it but when my parents and my grandparents, also the dentist asked about him...I knew things were getting worse. He was seen by 3 specialists in NH and was given 5mg of Ritalin 1/2 morning 1/2 afternoon, he has already had a profound change in his behavior. He doesn't stick his tongue out of his mouth at all and makes crazy noises, he can sit calmly now and concentrate, he actually played with some of his toy which he didn't really do before, only con so far..after 4 hours he has aggressive behavior and crying over nothing. Just started maybe that's why.;",7,
614,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,This is my miracle drug!;,10,
615,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"Took Ritalin when I was first diagnosed with ADHD. Because I was older (20's) and taking such a high dosage (60 mg morning, 60 mg afternoon, 20 mg late day) they changed me to a more sustained release drug. ;",10,
616,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. It seems I also have ADHD, Idiopathic Hypersomnia (not narcolepsy, but an unknown reason for excessive sleepiness), and a host of other symptoms. Ritalin was a life saver. I am able to think clearly again, I can wake up in the morning, and stay awake during the day, and my creativity is back (Artist/Crafter). It seems my tolerance is building, so my doctor tried me on LA; in a 1 month test I had a rocky start, but once my system adjusted it worked wonderfully. However, now my insurance company won't pay for it. Always one step forward, two steps back.;",10,
617,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"my 8 year old DAUGHTER is on ritalin at the moment we find she is getting migrane headaches, she hast lost 3kgs due to lack of appetite and she is very emotonal coming off it and she doesnt sleep much. On the other side of things she has shown a large improvement at school with her concerntration going from the bottom of the class to the top of the class in just 3 months;",5,
618,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"Works very well in the begining. After a couple of months induces tolerance. Anyway, it changed my professional and personal lifestyles. Now I pity of the person I was. I never experienced a linear and practical thought until I used this.;",9,
619,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I have 9 yr old twins who have ADHD. They've been on Concerta we are up to 36 mg and it was doing nothing. When they started having side effects - constant picking of scalp, sniffling, and puckering of mouth they were taken off. We then went to Adderall and they both got very aggressive. We are now on Ritalin 20 mg. One just started today so I'm not sure how it's going to go with him but the other has been on it for awhile and he's doing so good. He wants to take it, it makes him happy he says. Today when I took them to school he held his 5yr old brothers hand when they walked in. For some people that may not be a big deal but before he didn't want anything to do with him. He is very talkative on it but very sweet and helpful.;",8,
620,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,but makes me feel dizzy.;,10,
621,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,Ritali doesn't work for me but Concerta does. My dosage is 72 mg of Concerta. 200 mg of Seroquel and 20 mg of Ritalin.;,5,
622,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I'm a 40 year old male who didn't have the benefits of medications when I was in school. ADD wasn't as well known back then. I was diagnosed with hyper dyslexia. I always thought that it was strange because I didn't see letters backwards but I just accepted it. I was officially diagnosed with ADD in my mid 20's. I have taken most of the medicine options over the past 12 years including Concerta, Strattera, Adderall, Ritalin and Ritalin LA. Couldn't sleep on Concerta, I was out of my mind with Strattera, Adderall was like popping caffeine pills and Ritalin was too high maintenance as it neutralized after 2-3 hours. Then I found Ritalin LA. It's not the magic bullet but it's the best that I have found so far. It costs me 10X generic but worth it.;",9,
623,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I felt very groggy and out of it for while on this drug, I felt like I could barely form a thought and had great difficulty interacting with people while on it. I had no feelings, no emotions it felt like if I had to choose an emotion it would be disoriented.;",3,
624,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"For years I had been battling behavior problems with my son who is now 10. He was not a bad child but had no concentration span, would fidget, annoy others and was falling way behind children the same age as him. Finally we managed to get him seen by a specialist. He is now been on Ritalin 15mg for 4 months and the change is unbelievable. He is already catching up with his school work, making more friends as he understands them better and is generally just more content and happy. At first he was teary and clingy when first put on them but that soon went. The only down for my son is that he is not as hungry as he used to be and lost a lot of weight in the beginning but is steadily putting it back on now.;",10,
625,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I love Ritalin. I have a wonderful peace that I never had before. I am 61 years old and have just started taking it for the last few weeks. I can actually concentrate now. I am not so fidgety. I wished had this about 55 years ago and one thing I noticed, I am dreaming where I don't remember dreaming in years.;",10,
626,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"My 7 year old son has shown ADHD symptoms for about 2 years or so but due to many changes in his life, I was unsure of the reason for this behavior. Now we've been settled in for >9 months and he has not improved, we have decided to medicate (after dietary changes and omega 3 gave no help). He has been taking Ritalin 10mg for 12 days now. The 1st week he had only morning dose at 8am. This wore off around 1pm. This week I've dosed him 4 hours later also. From 1st day the change was amazing. He was attentive and followed instruction throughout his swim lesson and his school teacher found great improvement in attention span, concentration and finishing tasks. He is not as angry or frustrated now. The only negative is that I find he gets emotional and 'teary' as it wears off.;",9,
627,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,I used Ritalin when I was in 1st grade. Until I was in 6th grade these tablets helped me a lot with ADHD. But I outgrew the hyperactivity. The reason I rated it a 9/10 was because in 6th grade the medicine was working well but I was on 200mg of it so the doctor had to take me off of it fast. Then I had a Ritalin crash in a overnight hospital. But other than that it is a great drug for treating ADHD. It helped me pay attention and not to jump off my mom's dresser (the dresser story is true about me).;,9,
628,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"Diagnosed with ADHD at 53. Who knew there was a reason for my quirky personality. Tried Stattera and slept 15-18 hours a day, was switched to Ritalin and thought this was it. I really like how I feel, calm, focused. My friends noticed. I did great for a couple of weeks and then became extremely impulsive and inappropriate. I was focused, but on warp speed. I gained 10 lbs in a week, because I could not stop eating once I started, I went on shopping sprees, driving jags, blurted out without the think before you speak button. Once I started a task I had to finish, my kids were late to school, you get the picture. This was definitely not the drug for me. I stopped taking it a couple of days ago, I am still feeling the effect.;",4,
629,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"I've been on this medicine for about a month and lost around eleven pounds. I initially got on it to stay more focused in school although I don't have a serious case of ADD but I don't mind the weight loss. I could spare a few pounds. You get a rush for about 45 minutes after it kicks in and that feels better than it should. I feel I can concentrate when I use it, but I'm not myself when I take it. My personality is dulled a bit and even if I have homework to do, I'll find something to distract myself. Whether it's choosing a simpler assignment or just writing because I still feel like I'm being productive.;",7,
630,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,Ritalin helped me when I was young. Now I'm 27 and using it again.;,10,
631,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,Racing heart and head rushes when you first start taking the medicine... It was my life saver for high school and college and even now through life.. I can actually accomplish things in an orderly fashion.;,8,
632,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"Ritalin is a great medication for ADHD. I stay focused and on task. I am on 10 mg. up from 5 mg, which wasn't quite optimal. ;",9,
633,Ritalin,7,methylphenidate,"My doctor originally put me on Ritalin, and I stayed on it for 2 months. It made me very sick to my stomach, although it did improve my concentration. I have since switched to another medication and am doing much better.;",4,

635,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"At first, I had to take it with a high protein meal...and even then, I had some nausea. Now I've figured out a way for it to not cause nausea, yet get into my system: Take RIGHT BEFORE you go to bed! This way, it gets into my system, helps me to sleep 7-8 hours a night, and I feel in control of my feelings/moods instead of a slight """"fog"""" all the time. THIS medicine works; the others I've tried (Ritalin, Dexedrine) produced unwanted side effects. I'm staying with what works!;", 10,
636,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I have been on Strattera for 5 weeks now. I'm 48 years old and have been treated for bipolar and anxiety disorders from the age 19, have tried dozens of med combinations and have been hospitalized a few times when unable to cope. This last time a therapist suggested it may be ADHD and doctor put me on 40mg... its a night and day difference. I have never in my life had this kind of clarity and focus and other then dry mouth and a bit of a lost appetite side effect which is much better then past combinations.;",10,
637,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I've been using this for three years and it helps me. I've paid attention more at school. I've had no side effects at all, but all medications may have different effects on other people.;",10,
638,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I've been on Strattera since 3rd grade. And I don't understand why so many people are against it. I have only experienced good results with this drug. My grades have increased, I am able to focus in class, and I can excel and prosper. My doctor has told me that eventually I will be weaned off of Strattera because my brain should be able to adapt. All I can say is. I never experienced any horrible side effects, if any. I can't say I remember any side effects. And I know that it is not addictive since I am able to stop taking the drug during the summer time. I've had a moderately positive experience on Strattera. I hope everyone else does too.;",10,
639,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I was started on Strattera almost 3 years ago. Before taking this medication I was constantly on rabbit trails couldn't finish a project and trying to do 3 or 4 things at the same time, which I wasn't doing very well. I've probably been ADHD all my life but was not diagnosed until I was 50. I have gone back to school and work as an inpatient crisis stabilization nurse. I should be the poster child for this medication because it has been a miracle for me. I take 100 mg of the medication a day. The only thing I can complain about is the medication wears off sometimes before I get off of work. This probably could be fixed with a simple medication time and dosage change.;",10,
640,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I had taken Adderall, Concerta and other ADHD medications which all caused me to lose my appetite, get moody or come down from it and I felt I wasn't able to be myself. Strattera took a few weeks to kick in, I fell asleep constantly for the first two-four weeks (I know lots of people jump the Strattera ship then saying it is not working or making them sleepy) but after 4 weeks I started to feel like myself again. Except my mind got clearer, I could organize my room/now apartment, do all my school work, do everything I need to do, have better conversations and do not binge eat. I take 40mg and have had no side effects from it. It also helps my anxiety. It is my miracle.;",10,
641,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I currently take Topamax (for migraines) fluoxetine (Prozac)and Klonopin. I had tried Concerta but that """"pooped"""" out on me fairly quickly so I was suggested to try Strattera. I was hesitant at first knowing that there was a very low percentage rate of those for which the drug has actually worked successfully for but knowing my own body and mind maybe it would be a great idea to give it a shot. At first the side effects did start the headaches and the occasional upset stomach but they went away with time as my body got used to the medication and the higher dosage. No matter what, you should give this drug a chance.;",10,
642,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm a 32 year old male and have had symptoms of ADHD all my life, but chose not to treat it because the types of medications available seemed to 'take something away' from my personality. I finally reached a point that my wife begged me to do something, so I started with Strattera due to my doctor's recommendation. I've been on 40mg for 2 months now, and notice a major difference. I now have a desire to get on the floor and play with the kids, whereas before it seemed tedious and boring. I find that I'm not as tired at the end of the day/week because my thoughts are not distracted, by all the 'noise' that I seem to have from the ADHD. I'm still new to the drug, and things could change, but for now, I am really happy.;",10,
643,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I wanted to do an updated review on this medication. I am in my 9th month of taking it, and, before Obama Care I ran out a few times, and the effects were very noticeable. Even though it is not supposed to have classic SSRI withdrawal symptoms, I still had severe brain zaps. I have my script filled and I am back on it. I am such a better worker, listener and planner on this medication. I am a better version of myself. Love it! I take 40mg a day, 60mg was too much. I am 160lbs tall female 34 yo.;",10,

I was having a hard time constraining in class (I'm a college student) and it really helps me focus. The only down side is the occasional nausea but I found if I take it on an empty stomach the nausea isn't so bad. I would suggest this medicine.;,10,
646,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"As an adult living ADHD, I had no idea how it affected me. I was prescribed this by a psychiatrist, and almost immediately I was able to think more clearly, my memory felt better, I felt like I could concentrate on things. When someone spoke to me, I could actually listen and absorb what they were saying. Unfortunately I'm not on it anymore. It's hard to concentrate some days.;",10,

He has now been on Strattera for 2 years and has gone from straight D's in maths to A in achievement he can concentrate more retain information and does not lose it as he uses to. I have seen no side effects at all. At one point he went off it, lasted 5 days then chose to go back on it as he could tell that it helped his behaviour and way of dealing with things. I have only good things to say about Strattera.;",10,
648,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,My son was in kindergarten when he was diagnosed with ADHD. Strattera was the second medicine we tried and it worked great. His teacher and us at home noticed the change and could always tell if he missed his dose. He is now 13 and in 8th grade and has decided to take himself off the medicine. Hes been off it since before last summer and is doing great. Hoping because he was medicated at a young age that he may have out grown his symptoms. I would recommend Strattera to anyone.;,10,
649,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I have had ADD all my life. Starting in 5th grade, my psychiatrist put me on Concerta. I didn't eat well and I didn't grow for almost three years. When my doctor expressed concern, I was switched to Strattera. I am now a senior in high school, and have been on Strattera for five years. I haven't noticed any side effects and it has truly been a blessing in my life.;",10,
650,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Stratterra is incredible. I began taking it in 5th grade, after Adderall and Ritalin both failed me. I heard from my doctor that Strattera works for a less percentage of people than stimulants (like Adderall and Ritalin), but if you have had trouble with stimulants, Stratterra is worth a try. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and both Adderall and Ritalin caused me to have spontaneous anxiety attacks. While Strattera does not treat my anxiety, it does not increase it. Strattera will NOT work automatically, like stimulants. It took about a month for my Strattera to work, and in that month I experienced a lot of nausea, drowsiness and headaches. I encourage you to ask your doctor about Strattera if nothing else has worked.;",10,
651,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm a 30 year old male and switched from Dexedrine to Strattera about two years ago. For the first two months I thought it was a terrible decision because of the horrible side effects and talked to my doctor a couple of times about switching back to a stimulant. He told me that even though it says it can take up to a month to start working, in his experience, it took most patients 2-3 months to see the benefits. I'm glad I stuck with it. After four months all side effects we're completely gone and it works better than any stimulant type I've been prescribed. The problem is you do have to get through a horrible period of 1-3 months (10 weeks for me) before the nausea, fatigue, ED and insane sweating are gone. This drug takes time to work!!!;",10,

I finally got tested and diagnosed with ADHD, and after doing lots of research decided to try Strattera. This is the first and only thing I've tried for ADHD and I love it. I've been taking 40mg for two months and I've noticed a significant improvement in my ability to focus on and complete tasks without feeling distracted. It has calmed me down and I don't feel as edgy and agitated anymore. I'm able to control my emotions more and feel happier and more at ease. So glad I moved forward with this!;",10,
655,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Well, it only took 33 years for me (and a good doctor), to figure out what was wrong with me. I have had unexplained tachycardia (did EKGs and no problems, although never during an episode) since about age 8-9, I've had episodes of fainting, syncope, almost fainting, fatigue, being hyper and crashing. ADD symptoms, depression, mania. I have been treated for Depression and Mania, 3 years ago, and came oh so close to a solution, but the wrong meds made it even worse. Took 2 years to recover. Until, I got a new doctor, who treated my ADD and after two failed attempts to tolerate Adderall and Ritalin, prescribed Straterra, in the first 40 minutes I tool 25mg, my ADD symptoms subsided, and ALL other symptoms have resolved.;",10,
656,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I started taking strattera at 25mg. The first week was crazy I felt like I could do anything. I had so much time on my hands and accomplished so much. I no longer had to fight with myself to wake up. I had so much energy and """"the foggy"""" feeling was gone. I could focus and what I had to do do it and then move on to the next. It was wonderful. The only side effect I had was insomnia but that went a way after the first week and it was easily resolved with some meditation. After that I started to settle in because I was getting used to it the feelings were dying down. I missed the sense of euphoria the first week had brought but I was still plenty productive and over all my social relationships ad improved. After 3 months I am starting 40mg.;",10,

My thought patterns were like a slot machine with three or more thoughts going through my head at one time. Now my brain is quiet. It's amazing. I sleep well because I can turn off my thoughts. I have lost over 50 lbs. due to side effects at first, but now it's because I find that I focus on what I put in my mouth. It is nice to be able to wear skinny clothes again. I only need to lose about 30 more. Try this medication. I can't imagine not ever taking it. It has been a blessing.;",10,

Made a massive difference to my concentration levels and sustained energy, I had no idea it was possible to be this productive. Nausea was awful the first week (even threw up once) but faded quickly. I still need to eat alongside it to prevent nausea but since I take it at breakfast time its not a problem. only persistent side effect has been weight loss - abt 7 kgs in past 4 months - mostly due to appetite loss. I was on concerta (ritalin XR) beforehand and the side effects such as heart palpitations and insomnia were awful, also didn't help my adhd symptoms at all. I'd recommend strattera to people who've had bad results with stimulant adhd meds.;",10,

I am a 40 year old black female and have had struggles for many years while in school. I decided to go back to school and also tried this to see if there was a difference. It takes a while before you notice a change in the ability to focus. When earning my 1st degree, I struggled in school, probably all my life. While on Strattera, I could sit and study for hours and not be distracted. I went from struggling to earn C's maybe a B, to Earning A's and maybe a B. I actually understood what I was studying and didn't feel like doing 3-4 other things at the same time. I stopped taking it because of an EKG that showed an irregular heart beat. A side effect.;",10,

After a while, the increased energy was TOO MUCH so I decided to try strattera. I dropped the adderall dose and took them both together for a Few weeks before discontinuing the adderall. They feel virtually identical. I take strattera twice a day to avoid daytime sleepiness & no longer feel over stimulated and zombified and I have energy, & increased focus. I did have a headache for the first couple of days. Took an adderall yesterday and yup felt identical. Could barely tell a difference except got a bad headache at the end of the day on the come down and I also felt like a zombie again. Oh yeah, no come down on strattera!;",10,

However, only recently a clinical psychologist, who I went to for some testing, recommended Ritalin, Adderall which caused unpleasant side effects then Strattera 40 mg. Strattera has been the drug that works for me. I am definitely more focused and can stay focused on reading a book or newspaper article to completion without anxiety and frustration of having to read the same paragraph over and over again. I have always been treated with Paxil for anxiety attacks over the years but this drug seems to work better in that I am happy to feel more focused, interested and involved with everything I do and being with my kids seems to be more enjoyable for me. I EMBRACE these feelings.;",10,

Less sensitive - don't get hurt easily. Take criticism better. Wife notices big difference in mood- always thought it was depression. It's ADD and Strattera is perfect for it. Just hope it keeps working!;",9,

I took it for more than a year but had to stop because was too expensive for me even with insurance. I had some side effects that I mentioned to the company Lilly. These side effects were slight dizziness, nausea if taken without food, hair on the back of my neck would raise sensation, and some stomach discomfort, but the worst was the size of my penis would decrease incredibly while flaccid (normally 3 inches, but after medication, about 1 inch or less) and would take a lot of stimulation to get an erection.;",9,

Every time I go off of it or forget to take it for whatever reason, I have the same side effects when I start up again: severe nausea and dizziness, to the point where I have to lay down for up to an hour at a time. However, those pale in comparison to the benefits: I can focus, complete both small tasks and big projects, read and comprehend material more easily, and am infinitely more relaxed and less anxious. I've also been in recovery for a food addiction for the past three years and it's helped tremendously with the compulsive thoughts about food. Unfortunately I'm now noticing that the benefits seem to be wearing off, and I'm considering either upping my dosage or switching medicines.;",9,

It eliminated hot flashes entirely, I lost 50 pounds, I focus better. All else I just have to deal with.

Only lasted 4-6 hours but racing thoughts & heart palps at night. Now at 43-I had to ask Dr. repeatedly to prescribe Stratterra-non stimu-helps tremendously w/ anxiety & I can focus somewhat better.

Some side effects I have experienced is weight loss (almost extreme from 120 to 100 in 5 months) although I have gained about 5 pounds back and am still working on it. Also I am very thirsty all the time, so keep water with you everywhere! . Lastly I have to take it on a full stomach or else it will give me a severe stomach ache.

However, a possible side effect for me is hypothyroidism - but, I did have hyperthyroidism as a child so I don't know if Strattera caused it to come back as hypo or it's because of my age. I did unfortunately gain considerable weight, but with the thyroid pills, I have been slowly losing it again.;",9,

On other medications, I felt as though my thought patterns were altered or constrained.

We stopped the Ritalin and saw an improvement, though he was still easily distracted and disrupting the class. Doctor then said we should try Strattera. From what I had read about it I was not hopeful and expected bad side effect. To my surprise it worked from day one. No side effects.

I could use another dose by 3pm. I am thirsty all the time, dry mouth and not very hungry. I'm on my 2nd month and seeing how it goes.

I HAVE, however, noticed that I am biting my tongue on the right side of my mouth and when I forget to take the medicine this stops. It usually happens when I am concentrating, and while I was typing this review, I found myself doing it again. This is very strange, as I haven't heard about it. Also, when I get the shivers, I notice that they now linger at the top of my scalp. I am assuming this has something to do with increased blood flow in your brain or some such thing.;",9,

For me, the medicine kicks in about 1/2 hour after I take it and for the first 10-15 minutes or so, I get a sort of sleepy feeling but once I start a mental activity, it goes away. Its very weird because I tried to take it at night and although it gives me that """"sleepy"""" feeling, the medicine keeps my brain awake.

I'm also a calmer, less anxious version of myself, more patient mother. Things don't seem to bother me as much! My head is quiet.

When I'm not on it, I am a complete blob. I care very little about being productive and have issues even getting out of bed. Like, I will literally stay in bed ALL DAY.

I had her say the alphabet tonight and she was more focused and did not mispronounce a single letter. I am a FNP and WHNP so I have treated a lot of ADHD kids.

At about 40 mg I began to notice that I was able to concentrate better in school. When I got to 80mg I began to not daydream anymore and people found it easier to talk to me because I wouldn't be constantly jumping from subject to subject. My anxiety and sleep problem was also solved. However, after forgetting to take it one day, I got a massive headache, equal to a migraine.

I went to my doctor with a list of meds. and notes. He picked up on straterra, which wasn't top. The instructions said it may take a month to work! It was instant!

I was on Wellbutrin for a half a year, but got off due to having a rare side effect (muscle & joints hurting). Trying Strattera now, and as far as I can tell, it's very nice. Thoughts are organized, and I feel more relaxed (which is good because I might have anxiety - still being determined), none the less I get a lot more things done. Side effects are a bloody nightmare - hang in there! They do go away!

693,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"• Comprehension: Before: If you wanted me to pay attention, understand something, or even acknowledge it, you would often have to repeat it several times. I would misread or misunderstand things more than the average person. After: I understand most communication right away, including the emotions and attitude of the other person, which were often not even on my radar before. • Interpersonal Communication: Before: I was very likely to interrupt others. I wouldn't wait for others to speak before continuing my conversation. I came across as very harsh & critical. After: I'm better at engaging in appropriate give-and-take in conversation. I communicate in a much appropriate friendly tone. Dealing with adversity: Before: Even trivial matters would provoke a negative reaction, ruin my mood or trigger impulsive/disruptive behavior. I’d get down on myself for minor mistakes After: Even when things don’t go the way I like them to go, I handle things in a much more mature, measured way. When something goes wrong, I’m more likely to laugh it off than I used to. I’m more even keeled, less likely to fly off the handle.;",8,

I also found my psychological state was less effective if I became dehydrated. To counter the side effects I added All-Bran into my diet twice a week, and drank more liquids.

After the switch, I was back to feeling great until last week when I had another bout of depression. This morning I took 5mg of Ritalin and snapped right out of my depressed mood.

Used to be a troublemaker, now in college preparing for university, but has minor side effects for example I feel down and depressed randomly. I also feel drowsy for a little while.;",8,
705,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"80mg enables me to concentrate, I take it at bedtime. I have noticed a change in appetite, but that's good for me because I am overweight. I do have dry mouth a lot. Dr. is moving me up to 120 mg. So we will see how that works. I am able to get more done while on this medicine.;",8,
706,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm a 26 year old female and been taking Straterra for 2 weeks for ADD and I love it. Straterra has been a miracle for me. Before I would start projects and never finish them but now I finish them. I'm actually happy instead of being down on myself and staying frustrated all the time my husband says I smile and laugh a lot more. I am experiencing some of the side effects, dry mouth, chills weight loss and I don't eat near as much but I needed to lose weight and ate to much before taking the drug. I just hope this medicine continues to work for me because so far its awesome.;",8,
707,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,So far so good. Been taking about a week now & no noticeable side effects. Had to quit Adderall due to symptoms in re my heart. I have High Blood Pressure & ended up in ER for a myriad of strange & scary heart-related issues. PCP wanted me off Adderall since it's a stimulant & suggested Strattera as it is a SNRI. I take a SSRI for depression without incident so with this new one I guess time will tell.;,8,
708,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Better than a lot of other ADHD medications. Helped me lose 5-10lbs in only a month, but my weight remained the same for a while then went back up to original weight, probably because of starting other medications. Been on it for 8 months, and it has helped with reading and impulsivity related to ADHD, but does not give a boost of energy and productivity like Dexedrine or Vyvanse does.;",8,
709,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Straterra is changing my life. I held out for 4 months with the side effects and now the improvements are extremely significant. My memory is better and I can get myself easier into a concentration mode. Although it does not fight all symptoms, it enables you to start taking action against it, if that makes sense.;",8,
710,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I've tried Concerta alone, Strattera alone, Strattera with Wellbutrin, and am now taking Concerta 36 and Strattera 40 together. They have different effects, and I don't want to be without either one. Concerta works great for staying on target when I'm at work. Strattera works great at lowering irritation and provokability. Much slower to anger with the Strattera, able to brush off insults, has helped with marital problems. Strattera also makes me interested in my daughter and wife, improves my patience in reading a book, and reduces my urge for internet browsing. I had the often reported sexual side effects (leaking semen, painful ejaculation) at the 60 dose, so reduced to 40.;",8,
711,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My son, now 10, was diagnosed with impulse control issues. He has always had As and Bs in school and always loves to read. He gets bored alot in class and his impulse control (blurting out, saying what's on his mind/no filter) had caused him to be put in alternative school (where his grades began to falter). Over the summer, we had him evaluated and they said that meds would help. Our general physician didn't want to put him on a stimulant and suggested Straterra. First 2 months @ 60mg. Lost 15lbs (which put him at the right weight actually) and slept all the time. Backed off to 40mg since then and he's maintained his weight, sleeps well and maintained grades. Too bad our monthly script cost increased x9. Looking for a cheaper alternative.;",8,
712,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,My son only started Strattera this week. The first day his stomach was upset. Then we started taking it at night. It was mush better. I dont know if it is going to work but he says that he is feeling better already.;,8,
713,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I've been on every ADHD medication under the sun. After heavily abusing adderall and lying to my doctors, I broke out in a huge body rash that went all the way up to my face. I didn't like the way adderall made me feel. Like a zombie. I was wide awake, felt euphoric, but I didn't do anything. I just sat there for hours chainsmoking while on my phone. I decided to try straterra. I love it! It does everything adderall did minus the tweaky stimulant effect. And, I can't abuse it :) my adhd is under control, my depression disappeared, and I feel like myself again.;",8,
714,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I have been on and off Strattera for last two years. Strangely enough besides some dry mouth and dizziness at the beginning I have no side effects at all. I went up on my dose to 75 now. The only problem is that it is hard for me to say if it works or not.;,8,
715,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I did increase in awareness but the grades are still the same for me.;,8,
716,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,It may cause stomach irritation. ;,8,
717,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I was diagnosed with ADHD very late in life, at 55. My main symptoms are depression, anxiety, insomnia, lack of motivation/energy and a raft of others. I have tried every anti-depressant available, most of which didn't work or the side effects were too bad. I always seem to have to take high doses of medication, and ended up on 120mg of Strattera. It didn't do much for my concentration or cognitive symptoms, but after a few months I noticed my motivation getting better. However, it caused my quite severe cardiac symptoms and the dose was dropped to 100mg. I needed to think straight, so Methylphenidate was added. This was a great combination for me, apart from the side effects which often go away given time, but in my case didn't.;",8,
718,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"This medicine """"helps""""...it is not a cure-all. My biggest side effect is I CAN'T SLEEP...Thankfully this passes after a few weeks. Overall, I have found this medicine to be helpful.;",8,
719,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I had been on Strattera for 8 years. It did great but within last year things seemed to change. I thought it wasn't working due to my memory and concentration but now being off for about a month realize it was doing a lot. I am now having headaches lack of motivation loosing temper easily etc. My family and friends see a significant change in my behavior. (Negative change). Concentration and focus have always been an issue on and off medicine so I just have to work harder with it. Also realize it takes more than this medicine to really have success.;,7,
720,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 9. I'm now 22. I've been on many medications for it. My favorite would have to be Adderall because it works now. Strattera is time release and it takes weeks to actually notice a difference. If you have patience for it then I'd recommend it.;,7,
721,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm 30 and have taken several types of ADD medications since I was young. I stopped taking Adderall/Ritalin when I graduated from college (about 25 yrs old) because I did not like the side effect, particularly loss of appetite and jitteriness. I have since had to get back on meds because I have a sales job and I was making mistakes at work. I started on 25 mg a couple months back and it worked great at first, but has tapered off some. I wasn't sure if it was still working, but at night when the morning pill wares off and I can't get anything done and I'm super scatterbrained. That tells me it is working. I should probably take the doctor recommend evening dose, as well. Only complaint on side effects would be extreme sleep spells.;",7,
722,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,At first I hated it because it didn't give me the energy of Vyvanse and I desperately wanted my Dr. to switch me back. After a couple of weeks I realized that even though I was a little tired and not really focused I was calm and happy. This medication doesn't really do much for my ADD but it eases my anxiety that I always have had. I've tried many other medications and nothing worked for anxiety except for this one. It feels great to be calm and not worried about nonsense. Hope it keeps working for a long time to come.;,7,
723,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"This worked great for my ADHD symptoms. My family noticed an immediate improvement. I did get a little bit of weight loss, but that was good for me (38 years old). My biggest problem was that it caused erectile dysfunction and a strange lack of sensation in my prostate area, even at low dosage (18 mg/day). It was sufficient to stop use. I am on Adderall XR now which doesn't do nearly as well. My doctor is going to try me on some antidepressants as they also influence the norepinephrine levels. If you don't get the erectile dysfunction then this is a great medication.;",7,
724,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I have been in treatment for ADD for 15 years. As a result I have tried and used several of the standard drugs used for treatment including Adderall, Ritalin, Dexadrine, and Wellbutrin. About 3 years ago I began using Strattera. I was made aware that the medicine did not affect the dopamine levels but should still help prolong my attention time. Since then I have found this to be true. However, the difficulty is since the impact it is seemingly subtle. It's very difficult to gauge the effectiveness and to determine the proper dosage. After 2 years, my doctor and I are still tweeking this aspect. Overall, Strattera has worked to allow me to still have something for my family left after a long day work.;",7,
725,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I was on this for ADHD and while I did see a noticeable improvement in my ability to concentrate and not be running around acting all hyper, it worked a little too well if you know what I mean. I had a heck of a time getting ready for school and I'd fall asleep on the bus ride there (I was in high school at the time). I also couldn't keep my head up in first period and would constantly snap awake at loud sounds or giggles in the classroom, not realizing I'd even fallen asleep. It wouldn't wear off until second or third period, so mornings were awful. I would be so zombie-like and sleepy no matter how much rest I got the night before. Eventually I quit taking it because I didn't like feeling like a walking corpse in the mornings.;",7,
726,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My son was diagnosed with Autism, however he has symptoms of ADHD but is not. The ADHD meds. just made things worse for him so the Dr. gave me Strattera to try 10mg and it helped, I kept wondering why he could take this but not other ADHD meds. his pediatrician told me it is an antidepressant that was discovered to have a calming effect, and if it makes him tired take it at bedtime. It is very expensive but helps we have not been able to increase the dose, but kids on the spectrum are difficult to medicate.;",7,
727,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I have an 8 yr old son who has ADHD. He has tried several medications including Adderall and Vyvanse. Nothing has worked as well as Strattera for him. He's a new kid. So much happier. He used to have severe mood swings with the Vyvanse, although it did control his ADHD fairly well for about 5-6 hrs after he took it. Strattera has been a big help regaining some normalcy in his life. He is only on 10 mg daily for the last 3-4 weeks but it has made a very noticeable difference. I have not seen any negative side effects from it, and he is actually eating on it. Thank you Strattera.;",7,
728,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Can't tolerate stimulants, so only choice was non-stimulant medication. It does work, and I've definitely noticed a difference. First couple of days I'd get real sick for a couple of hours, pretty nauseated. But that went away after a while. For the first two months, I rarely felt hungry, I dropped 15 pounds, but my mouth was always dry, and I was drinking liters upon liters of water every day. Still some problems """"downstairs"""", if you know what I mean. Makes me pretty sleepy, so I usually take it right before I turn in for the day. But honestly, even with all the side effects, it works well enough that I do continue to take it.;",7,
729,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"It's maybe my 5th week on the drug, noticed an increase in my productivity and feel like I can get a lot done. Although I'm suffering from nausea and slight headaches, I'm taking other medications so it's hard to say. Tried Ritalin, Ritalin XR and Dex amphetamine also. This isn't as aggressive as Dex, but Dex is my preference in comparison to this. Though it's still early days!;",7,
730,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Diagnosed with having ADHD in my early 20's. Dr. wanted me to try out Strattera before a stimulant since I also have anxiety and he feared a med like Adderrall would make it worst. This is my second month on it and it does seem to be working. I am better able to concentrate and my head seems more """"clear"""". I'm on 80mg. Stomach-aches and drowsiness started off horrible when I first began taking this med but these side effects are almost gone. Still get dry mouth which ranges from mild to """"it feels like I've eaten cotton and sand"""". Unless the side effects are too intense for you, I would at least give this med two months. Think it gets such a bad rep because people don't give it a chance.;",7,
731,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My husband has ADD, and it really took a toll on our relationship. He was originally on Vyvanse, but it suppressed his appetite horribly. It didn't do enough in ratio to the side effects, so he decided to try Strattera. So far, it's been working decently. His main problem, however, is being able to urinate freely. I bought him Urinozinc Prostate Formula, and literally the first pill he took, he was able to urinate much more easily. Conversely, when he forgot a pill the other day, he noticed an immediate difference, and struggled to urinate. The supplement has allowed him to stay on Strattera. I note this stuff, as I have read that this is a common issue for men taking Strattera. Hope this helps others.;",7,
732,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I am an adult in my late 30's. I have taken this drug off and on for the last year and a half, because my medical doesn't cover it and it is very expensive for me. When I was given samples, my family can see the difference in my thoughts and organization.;",7,
733,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I've been on Straterra for about two months and am up to 40mgs, with the exception of dry mouth and some manageable stomach aches, the medication seems to work pretty well--and subtly too. I am a very young 48 and I was diagnosed as """"hyperactive"""" in 1972. I was on Ritalin at a very young age. While it's NOT a cure, it works much better than stimulant medications as an adult--I read better and seem to not interrupt as much. Coffee effects me quite a bit and if I keep it down that helps too. I was worried about all of the reviews of sexual side effects--I seem to be up and running, this worried me a lot. Once again, I'm not saying Staterra this is a cure all, but my experience seems to be very different than many reviews I have read;",7,
734,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I have ADHD and am 27 years old. I have been using Strattera for four months. The first month I was taking too much and made me really sleepy. After spliting the two 40mg up that worked well. People around me that didn't know I was taking anything said I seemed more relaxed and easygoing. ;,7,
735,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I definitely noticed a difference while taking Strattera. The symptoms of my ADHD have improved indefinitely. I feel less withdrawn from reality, increased self esteem and better focus. The 25mgs gave me insomnia. With the 40mg I stopped noticing the benefits of Strattera and noticed more of the side effects (dizziness, hot flashes, etc). 60mg seemed to be the most effective for me. But after a week of taking the 60mg, I didn't go a day without nausea. The nausea was so bad that it practically cancelled out the benefits of Strattera. This is just what happened in my case. I would recommend this medication in hopes that the side effects aren't as bad for others.;",7,
736,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm 46 and recently diagnosed with ADHD. Straterra is the first and only medication I've tried for this condition. I've been on it for 2 weeks and notice profound improvements in my ability to concentrate, absorb material, and complete tasks. That is what I had hoped to achieve with Straterra. However, I am experiencing some unpleasant side effects, including difficulty urinating (very slow flow and the sensation that I'm not finished after my bladder is empty) and """"frothy"""" ejaculations during sex that occur without any sensation of orgasm. For now, I can accept the trade off, as I am much more productive at work. But I'm really hoping these side effects disappear or diminish.;",7,
737,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I had mild trouble sleeping and developed Raynaud's after 2 years of taking this.;,6,
738,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"(18 years old, 104lbs, 5'0) I was on 25 mg and switched to 40mg as I hadn't noticed anything after a month. So far I have dry mouth sometimes, feel more tired, nausea after taking pill. Also, those around had noticed that I am blah all the time after I take it and that I completely change from my upbeat personality to very flat. I will be talking to my doctor about taking a stimulant instead so I won't have to take it everyday.;",6,
739,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I was given a starter pack of a month long supply of Strattera from my Psychiatrist. I'm currently about two weeks in (starts you at 20mg and ends at 80mg) and the reason I am giving the drug this rating is due to me being unsure about how it's affected me thus far. When I first started to take it my anxiety subsided and I felt normal and back on track again. This lasted for the first week. I was even able to travel alone to be with my fiancé in Mexico. I've never traveled much, let alone by myself. I did this with ease. Now back from my trip and having increased the dosage to I believe 60 or 80 right now, I don't feel the same. Sadly. :-( I'm disheartened because I thought this was my cure all after a terrible winter.;",6,

742,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I have been taking Straterra for around six days now. I'm starting to notice a bit of a difference, a positive difference. I feel a lot calmer, I don't feel so emotional. I'm also studying much better. I can read up to twenty to thirty pages of lengthy legal text without losing concentration. I have a history of depression, so my psychiatrist put me on Strattera for my ADHD and symptoms of depression. I am going to review my rating of this drug in a month or so, but for now I'm quite happy. ;",6,
743,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"It worked quite well in the first 2 weeks with a lot of things. My thought process, my mood, my socializing, getting school work done much faster, not procrastinating. Then after 3 weeks on the medicine, it plummeted. I had more side effects after 3rd week when dosage raised to 20 mg as 10 mg did not work. Had heart palpitation, was sweaty, muscle weakness, extremely tired.;",6,
744,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I started taking Strattera a few weeks ago for ADD. I have noticed it makes me really calm compared to my usual ways. It helps me focus a little better than I used to but I am still not really focused during class. I take 80mg a day, yes I know that's a lot but that's what was prescribed for me. I have completely lost my appetite. Some days go by and I realize I haven't eaten anything. I have lost 10 lbs. Other than that it just gives me a really dry mouth. I always take over the counter sleep aids so I always sleep fine. I wonder if I should try Adderall? Concerta I have already tried and did not like it.;",6,

746,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I have been on Straterra for about two months. It certainly has a subtle affect that creeps up on you. It is not a stimulant so does not have that quick hit affect. While taking it I feel a little dopey... but if I have been on it for a while and then lower the dose to one every two days. I can really feel the difference in my performance and focus. I went through a stressful experience which brought on some mania. Stay off this medicine if you go through a similar experience. It heightens panic and intensifies anxiety. Other then that seems to be good.;,6,

I also felt a little agitated but my anxiety level did go way down on this medication. I also had to take it at night because it made me very sleepy.

At times it gives me head aches and irritability due to me feeling off. It is very effective in controlling my hyperactivity. I am much more attentive. Its benefits out weigh its current side effects, I recommend talking to your doctor and to keep trying new medicines to find out what works best for you. I gave it a 6/10. Its expensive, $140ish;",6,

It took a while to get out of the system. On the other hand, my 11 year old daughter is taking Strattera 25mg, and it has worked great for her. She is reading like crazy, and she's never been able to focus enough to read. When ever she took stimulants, she would get a lot of stuff done, but she would be anxious and sad. This medication is the only one that she's taken that didn't make her sad. I rate it a 5 because it worked terrible for one child, but has been great for the other.;",5,

The first day I took it, it put me to sleep. After a few days of sleeping a lot I could focus! The only bad thing was when I worked out I would get funny vision, like I was going to pass out. Which doesn't help since I'm a fitness professional. I think the lower dosage worked better, once I went up to 60 I couldn't focus, slept all the time, felt depressed, and the vision got worse.

The S/E definitely more pronounced if I'm not doing anything so I try and stay active and never take this on an empty stomach! I'll give it 2 more weeks at 120mg (which will be 6 weeks total) then gently titrate down. It gives me palpitations, too, which make me unhappy. I get this free on NHS in UK.;",5,

I noticed nausea almost immediately after I started taking the medicine along with unusual bouts of tiredness. I continued with the plan as I was told some of the initial side effects would ease as my body became accustomed. The side effects began to get worse, with frequent sweats, occasional sore throat, EXTREME tiredness, and the worst constipation I have ever had.

I can't really tell if it's working yet since I'm only in my second week, but so far I'm not too optimistic. I was on Wellbutrin before and that had little to no effect on me. I don't feel depressed at all but I will say my anxiety has diminished. As for the ADD I guess will just have to wait and see.;",4,
764,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,Strattera helped my ADD very little and suppressed my appetite and I lost all ability to sleep even though I was always tired.;,4,
765,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,Got sick a good three times during the first week and felt dizzy. Continued to take it for another 2 weeks every morning but it made me drowsy to the point that I had to take a nap everyday. Switched to taking it at night before bed and could not sleep at all. On a positive note I did notice my concentration levels increased a bit but was surprised how I could read an article or a textbook and remember the information I had just read.;,4,
766,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,It was very expensive and provided no help.;,4,
767,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm a 47 year old female. Dr. gave me the free packet that works up from 20mg to 80mg. Took it for only about 3 weeks and then quit. Did not notice any help with ADHD, although I may not have given it long enough. However, the side effects were: increase in blood pressure, feeling my heart beating hard, sleepiness, getting winded very quickly from just walking less than a block. This medicine is not for me. Even though it is not a stimulant, it seemed to affect my cardiovascular system, and the symptoms were just not worth it.;",3,
768,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Worked for a half year, then I got paranoid, depression and ADHD started to show, and had really bad headaches.;",3,
769,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I was 20 when I started staking Strattera. As far as focusing yes, I was completely focused and motivated all day! If I was sitting still I would have to pull out my phone and play a game to keep my mind moving. However the side effects were absolutely terrible! I was constantly sweating and if I wasn't sweating I had chills! I began suffering from insomnia. I have constant dry mouth and headaches. The worst side effect by far was what it did to my menstrual cycle. It gave me a EXTREMELY heavy and very crampy cycle. It also made my very regular cycle completely irregular. The side effects made it not worth it at all.;",3,
770,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I couldn't handle the side affects. Night sweats with intense anxiety and nausea. Couldn't sleep. Terrible. Only lasted 2 weeks.;,3,
771,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I got way to many mental and physical negative side effects and it didn't seem to help that much. Although at times I felt I could pay attention better. I was only on 10mg. My doctor told me to stop taking it and now I have to see a psychiatrist.;,3,
772,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Been on Strattera for 3 months and can't wait to get off it! It had helped my concentration to an okay extent but I'm having bizarre side effects such as leaking semen followed by testicular pain, paranoia, weird thoughts, anxiety and slight tics. Not recommended for long term use!;",3,
773,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I have been looking for a medication that will keep me at a stable pace all day, not with the several ups and downs I experience on Motiron and Ritalin. I have tried Adderall, Ritalin, Straterra, and more than 3 other medications. But of all the medications I have tried, Straterra gave me the worst side effects by far. I felt sick to my stomach, irritable, toxic, I had a headache for 3-4 hours a day and the come down was terrible. I went through extreme periods of depression and anxiety while on this medication for only 2 weeks! I know some people can feel the effects after a few weeks, but for me it just wasn't worth it to continue. Hope it works for others but this non-stimulant was all side-effects and no help for my ADHD.;",3,
774,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Taking it for adult ADHD and it doesn't work. Still focus in my classes, no appetite and very moody, coupled with insomnia. ;",3,
775,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, found symptoms lessened with Wellbutrin XR. Year later diagnosed with adult ADHD, all ADD with little HD. Started Strattera and felt a slight improvement in focus, but also felt distant and flat. Stopped Strattera due to severe constipation. Tried Adderall, little effect on focus and concentration, and turned into a Chatty Cathy. I did sleep better than ever though. Next, Ritalin with close to the same effects, but without the great sleep. Back to Strattera to give it another shot, constipation lessened, but still feel that it is not helping with the ADD. Considered adding Adderall or Ritalin in with, but Doctor now recommending psych evaluation to look deeper. Scary, but necessary.;",3,
776,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I experienced decreased physical ability, lost muscle tone and stamina. My sexual desire dropped sharply. I was unable to motivate myself and had no desire to do anything. This drug takes away individual thought and makes you do things without the desire or want to do them.;",3,
777,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I have been on Strattera for 6 years. I take one 18mg a day. When I take it I don't feel like myself. I feel depressed. I feel tried all the time. So for me I don't like it but so far they haven't found anything else that will work for me.;,3,
778,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Since I've been on strattera I've felt tired & listless -- I can't even work up enough energy for essentials like laundry & dishes. I've been on it for 5 months. My worst side effects are nausea, fatigue, irritability, and strange dreams. It feels like I start dreaming before I even fall asleep and it's driving me crazy. In typical ADHD fashion I forgot my meds at work over the weekend & had to go without -- I woke up at 4am to the worst headache I've ever had. I have an appointment on Wednesday & will be doing my damnedest to get my doc to switch me to a different med. I think it did a little for my ADHD but I also upped my coffee intake while I was on this med.;",3,
779,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My doctor gave me a free sample pack of Strattera and had me start at 20mg, and increase the dose all the way to 80mg. I didn't notice a difference until I got to 60mg, and at 80mg, the side effects became all too apparent. I noticed that I was able to focus on a particular topic for longer periods of time, but that's it; my motivation, procrastination, sluggishness, irritability, memory problems, all remained the same. Now for the side effects, my head starts to itch, my testicles become very tender, but worst of all I start to get depressed. I don't think this medication is for someone without the Hyperactivity part of ADHD. Because I am sluggish enough as it is.;",3,
780,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,Took this since 3rd grade. It made me tried and I became depressed. After getting off the pills I became myself again. I took it from 3rd grade till about 8th grade. I'm now in 10th grade with no ADHD meds at all.;,3,
781,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm only on day 1 with 40mg dose, but I noticed the front of my brain hurts and I'm endlessly thirsty. Getting up and sitting down has made me a little dizzy also. Hope it gets better with time or I'll ask doc for a change of meds.;",3,
782,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I have been on Strattera for 4 months. I still find myself procrastinating a lot. I never eat, I lost 7 pounds the first week I was on it. Doctor then gave me Adderal. I find it way better except the fact it keeps you up all night.;",3,
783,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"The side effects were terrible. The first day my heart was racing so fast, I had dry mouth, headache, chills, sweating, and woke up every hour after falling asleep at 10pm. I usually sleep through the night. The 2nd day of taking Strattera my eyes were dilated and my husband said my eyes looked weird. I thought I would sleep better since I took the medicine in the morning but I was wrong. Fell asleep at 10pm, woke up sweating with a fast pulse...really fast. Woke up every 2 hours. Just terrible. The 2 days I took it I had energy to do tasks around the house but the side effects of not sleeping and my eyes dilating were too much. Plus my heart rate was all over the place.;",3,
784,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Did not seem to notice much improvement, was on it for probably 8-10 wks.;",3,
785,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"It works, is all I can say. Started on the sample pack at age 12 (I am 16 now, but will never forget my experience). It worked, I cannot say that it didn't, but it gave me the worst side effects possible. After about a month of the medicine, I was diagnosed with depression as a result of Straterra. When I took it, in probably 2011, the box said, """"may cause suicidal thoughts or actions"""", which my physician did not warn me about. Then all of the sudden I was extremely depressed and suicidal and my psychiatrist discovered that Straterra was the cause. He has had several cases before where the mental illness was caused by a drug, and nothing else. Good medicine, just beware of the side effects!;",2,
786,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"well...... it worked. that's about all I can say.You'll be able to focus, and if you don't mind the fact that the ONLY thing you'll be able to focus on is how tired, nauseated, and occasionally slightly mad you feel, this is the medicine for you. despite that, it's worth nothing that i'm only 17 and ~130 pounds which is really close to the minimum weight on the box. based on what i've seen, it seems to work better for ~30 year olds who aren't underweight. not a professional, obviously, though, so take this with a grain of salt.;",2,
787,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"All it did was make me feel like a zombie. I personally don't recommend this drug, as it only makes you get nauseous and very tired, and causes insomnia.;",2,
788,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"The negative side effects were too much to deal with. I couldn't handle the IRRITABILITY, agitation, depression, decreased libido and penis size, constipation, chemical odor in my excessive sweating. I couldn't remain in a deep sleep at night, feelings of helplessness and insecurities only when using Strattera. Sadness and I can understand how suicidal thoughts tend to develop on this medication. There was a slight increase in my concentration. After discontinuing abruptly the most intense nightmares and sleepless nights followed. Good luck, I hope you're one of the fortunate ones that this medication worked for. I am a 30 yr old male.;",2,
789,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Recently diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 22, and am a full time college student with difficulties getting my responsibilities and homework assignments done. Started on 40mg once a day with instructions to bump up to twice a day after 3 days if I needed. I refused to bump up because of the crappy effects. I know some people have had great results with this drug, but I was not one of them. The only positive thing I noticed was the ability to tune out outside noises and distractors, but those distractions your own head puts out are still there. Side effects: complete revulsion to food, sluggish and lethargic, lack of motivation or enthusiasm, and EXTREME irritability. By the 5th day, I refused to take it.;",2,
790,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"15 year old female with ADHD and mild depression. This sent me into a downwards spiral of suicidal thoughts and erratic behavior. It also caused me to throw up and miss meals due to the 'stuck in my throat' feeling it gave in addition to the burning acid in my throat feeling. Also it gave me headaches so severe I wouldn't even get out of bed. I give this a 2/10 because although it did help a little, the negative side effects are too much for me.;",2,
791,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My 7 year old son with Autism/ADHD took this to decrease impulsivity. He got insomnia, rages/aggression, completely out of control. It would happen about 4 hours after taking 25mg. It also interferes with his asthma medicines- Albuterol. Not for us.;",2,
792,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My son, 11, was taking Strattera and it did not work out well for him. His ADHA is rather mild, and I thought this could help him with a few of his struggles. However, the side effects outweighed the benefits. The most extreme side effect didn't really hit until about a month into taking Strattera. He became very emotional, would lash out disrespectfully and within 5 minutes would be crying and saying how sorry he was. His brain clarity actually was WORSE. He has always been a honor student and suddenly couldn't remember his multiplication facts. Last side effect was his appetite was suppressed. He has been off the medication for 5 days and I have my kid back.;",2,
793,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My son began taking Strattera about 3 - 4 years ago. He had a bad reaction to Adderal, so the doctor tried Strattera as a non-stimulant. He first started 18 mg once a day, no noticeable change. Then increased over time to 50 mg once a day. He wasn't defiant, but just didn't (doesn't) care to do much of anything. 4-6 weeks ago he started having """"tics"""". Not putting the two together, last month his doctor increased to 60 mg a day and the tics have continued to get worse. He's also been more depressed, having panic attacks, and anxiety. He goes to school, but gets nothing done. Went back to his doctor and she know has started taking him off this medication. I hope the tics stop. He's scared and this continues to add to his anxiety.;",2,
794,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I'm a 24 year old female who was prescribed strattera and Ciprolex combined. I have been diagnosed as ADHD and mild depression. I was on Ciprolex for a number of years before strattera and had no side effects but when I started taking Strattera within 2 days I had heart palpitations, dizziness, sleepiness and nausea. I stayed on the medication because I could not focus on even the most basic of tasks so I dealt with these side effects. After a year I started to feel great!! So I weaned myself off and within 2 months I became such an angry, depressed and filled with anxiety over nothing. Anxiety to the point where I thought I was going to be sick. So now I'm stuck dealing with these pills or be worse than before.;",2,

799,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"This was my first time trying ADHD medication, and unfortunately it didn't go so well. My nurse practitioner warned me that there was a chance of panic attacks with Strattera, as I had previously had some with Wellbutrin, but I was unprepared for how intense they would be. Even on a very low dose. The first one happened on 10 mg, and there were several others on 18 and 25. I didn't take the higher step up, and had to stop. I know there are a lot of people who love Strattera, but anyone who's had a panic attack on Wellbutrin might want to avoid it.;",1,
800,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,Hated it!!! I was taking adderall for a year and it started making me feel anxious maybe one day a week. I was switched to this and once I started it my anxiety got really bad. I've never had a problem with anxiety and I really feel for the people that suffer from chronic anxiety! I also had a problem with dropping blood pressure (could be from adderall withdraw tho) I also had HORRIBLE mood swings. As soon as I would take it I was very negative about everything. I'm so glad to be off it now and so is my boyfriend!!;,1,
801,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"Eighteen year old female, just started taking Strattera on Thanksgiving. Slept through the entire day and night, had lucid dreams, woke up angry and crying. I tried it a second day, Friday, and managed to stay awake (more due to the fact that I was reading a good book). I refused to take it on Saturday because I was visiting family and I didn't want to be moody or drowsy around people that I get to see maybe twice a year. Took it again this morning, barely managed to finish a short story before falling asleep in the car, which I have NEVER done before. Still feeling the effects of it right now, got yelled at for falling asleep, still moody, still have homework to do. I'll check back in a few days after school. ;",1,

803,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I hate this medication. My doctor gave it to me and says to keep taking it in order to feel the effects but I took it a few hours ago, I have the shakes, I get so hot and feel totally out of it. I can't wait til this feeling is over. I will not take it again;",1,
804,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,It made me want to sleep all day and made me extremely nauseated. After a month of taking 40mg it didn't touch my ADHD and after a month of 60mg still nothing happened except the side effects. ;,1,
805,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"My 8 year old daughter was prescribed this medication yesterday by our PCP. For the past 6 months she was on Adderrall 10mg and I decreased her to 5mg two months ago. She weighs.64 lbs and 10 mgs of adderrall had her like a zombie, the 5 most recently caused her to become anxious, overly sensitive, and literally trichllomania - literally developing the habit of pulling her out. I stopped the adderall this week and her doctor suggested Strattera. I got an email from my daughters teacher after sending her to school on the 1st day of her new meds. My daughter was experiencing super fatigue, headache, and nausea. She was definitely calm, but she could not eat dinner and my baby was so hot to the touch. I will NOT give her any more meds.;",1,

After a few days of feeling tired all day, I realized something was very wrong. I also read that there is a possible interaction with Wellbutrin XL, which I am also taking. I stopped the Strattera and am back to """"normal"""" again.;",1,
811,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I started with a low dose and then took the highest dose. I noticed nothing for the first two months and then I felt suicidal, derpressed and it did nothing for my ADHD. It was costly even with insurance and I had to stop taking it. Now I'm stuck with my ADHD and never have I felt worse than I did on this medication. It messes with your mind.;",1,
812,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,I began Strattera two days ago and the first day I had problems urinating immediately. I also noticed problems holding an erection. Day two was even worse as I could hardly urinate and when I got sexually exited I could not have an erection at all. I have never had sexual problems before and urinating has always been normal. I blame Strattera because it's the only new medication I was taking. I also take Lithium for depression and Prozac for my sexual addiction. ;,1,
813,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"I had such high hopes for Strattera, but it was completely ineffective and actually made my condition worse. I wanted it to help me focus on work: sending emails, making phone calls, generally being able to work at a computer and other things. I started at 40mg a day, and found myself slightly more tired. I raised it to 60mg a day and seemed to get more tired and less motivated to get anything done. Finally I went to 80mg and still no help with focus. I just found that I was lethargic, unmotivated and tired. I took naps and lazed around, but didn't get as excited about things as I had before the medicine. My job requires creativity, and it's hard to be creative if you're not excited about it. So I actually became LESS productive.;",1,

The doctor said after a week or 2 it should start to work. I took it for 2 weeks and continued to get cold sweats, shivers, and just felt like crap so I stopped taking it. It didn't help one bit. It made me feel like I was on a anti depressant or something. All around terrible experience and I will never take it again. I'm at my doctors today to rectify the situation;",1,
815,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,My doctor tried to put me on this. It gave me heartburn and a bad headache. I was not able to control bowel movements either. Sometimes I would actually stain the back of my pants. One good thing is I had an erection for hours. It did make me lose 40 pounds the first month I was on it though.;,1,
816,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,At first the drug company advertised this mercilessly as the solution to adult ADHD. The only problem is that it doesn't work. I noticed nothing at all in the three months I tried it.;,1,
817,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,My doctor gave me a 30 day trial of Strattera with incrementing doses each week. It started with 10mg and the last week was 60mg. I didn't really notice a positive difference with any dosage but I did have an extremely detailed and horrific dream the first two nights but after that my sleeping was normal. As far as side effects other than the two night terrors I was slightly constipated. It took a lot more effort to make myself do #2. I'm currently on Adderall XR and it seems to do the trick.;,1,
818,Strattera,8,atomoxetine,"This medication was not a good match for me. I was dizzy, nauseous and sleepy. I had to move very slowly in order not to make side effects worse. I only took one 45mg dose. I was given a verbal list of possible side effects from the pharmacist. I tried to keep an open mind as everyone may not experience negative side effects but in this case I did. I am an adult with ADD so I was prescribed this to help symptoms of inattention.

I continued taking my dosage daily and did not notice anything on the first week of my 40 mg dosage. However, I did start developing irrational thoughts. For example, I began thinking everyone hated me, soon after, I started becoming suicidal. I tried killing myself by overdosing on opiates, but my roommate called the ambulance.

It turns out I have ADHD, I was started off on 50mg which automatically kept me calm, quiet and eager to pay attention and learn. I passed all my classes my 9th grade year. Currently, I'm almost complete with 10th grade. I am passing everything and doing an excellent job keeping up with school, homework and my job. I've gone from 50mg to 70mg. I didn't think I could feel the need to take this so much. When I don't take it, I can't hold my eyes open. I binge eat in bed, half asleep. But this does keep your mind off hunger, I went from 190lbs to 125lbs in a year.;",10,
836,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse has been wonderful for me. I take it along with the anti-depressant Lexapro and the two medications work wonderfully together. I am a full time college student. I have been taking Vyvanse for about 8 months and I don't know what I would do without it now. I am focused and my mind is not racing a million miles an hour. I did about a year of school without it and I was an A, B, C student, but now I am mostly making A's with the occasional B.;",10,
837,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 9 year old son has been on Vyvanse for five years now he started out with 20mg he is now up to 70mg it works great my 5yr old little girl was just put on Vyvanse 40mg after trying numerous other ADHD medicines. It works well, I was on Ritalin for 25 years. I did not want my kids on that so glad the Vyvanse works.;",10,
838,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My son is 12 and uses Vyvanse 50mg. I have seen a big difference in his behavior and attitude. We tried quite a few other ADHD prescriptions but this one is a miracle.;,10,
839,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I have to say that this has been a great drug that has done so many good things for my Granddaughter that I have adopted. She is 7 years old with ADHD. She was so unhappy and would even tell me that she knew something wasn't right and wanted to be a good kid like the ones in her class room. She was in tears and asking for help. This is the first drug for her ADHD and it has worked great! Some side effect not eating and not sleeping good at night. But over all this drug has work great so far.;,10,
840,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,It is magic;,10,
841,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have identical twin boys that are eight years old. They were both diagnosed with ADHD at a young age. At first we did everything possible to avoid medicines. After 1 year we started with adderall the extended and immediate release, 2 pills a day and were impressed. It's effectiveness was noticeable once the medicine wore off (moodiness, short temper,and rebound hyperactivity). After 2 years we were introduced to Vyvanse and it is great. They only take one pill daily and it lasts 11-12 hours without the rebound side effects. The only problem is eating they don't have much of an appetite throughout the day.;",10,
842,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Most awesome medicine I've ever been prescribed. I can focus, I am not irritable. I feel like I have a life now. Thank you Vyvanse.;",10,
843,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I have been a mental health counselor for 37 years and have worked with ADHD for 25 Of all the medications Vyvanse is the best. It is important to start low 20 mg and then increase based on focus concentration and mid afternoon agitation. Expect very few side effects. Slight appetite loss but manageable. Very important to take it at 7am everyday. May want to hold off on weekends unless there is need to focus for study. Consider counseling to help stay on track and educate client and family regarding the fact that ADHD is a gift of creativity and out of the box thinking.;,10,
844,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,A miracle pill. First time in my life I finally feel normal and can function like a normal person.;,10,
845,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 51-years old and was skeptical regarding ADD or ADHD. A counselor urged me to get tested. I agreed to do it because all I wanted was help. I no longer cared what the answer was for whatever was wrong. I only cared if it worked. So, I did the test and was told I was """"off the charts"""" the highest scores they had seen in years of testing. Today I take 120-150 mgs of Vyvanse daily and it makes a difference. Nonetheless, even though Vyvanse has been very helpful, I still doubted whether ADHD was """"real."""" I couldn't understand why the medicine was so highly regulated. How could anyone get addicted to this stuff I thought? Then I realized people like me don't get high from drugs like this and that's one reason I know it's working and ADHD is real.;",10,
846,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,This medicine has changed my life as a student and a person.;,10,
847,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I started using this medication about 4 months ago. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 5 years old. The only annoying thing about this medication is that it keeps my mouth extremely dry. I found that using hard candies (regular or sugar free) helps a lot. Vyvanse has helped me a lot, especially with my concentration. I can actually read a book without having to read the same page 3 times, but the only thing is that it feels like my blood pressure goes up, I also have tachycardia. ;",10,
848,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son (ADHD) has been on Vyvanse for about 3 years now, and I love it. He is 10 years old now. He started out on Focalin which he took for about 3 months and never seen a change in him. So his doctor switched him to Vyvanse and the very first day I noticed a change in him. Calm and relaxed, but not a zombie like I heard a lot of ADHD medicines do. He always made A's & B's but since on Vyvanse he has made all A's, I believe it's due to he is able to sit still in his seat and concentrate more. The only side effect I have seen in him is his appetite. He does not have one and is on the skinny side. But we found a way to get him to eat so hopefully he will gain amlittle. Other than that this medicine its WONDERFUL.;",10,
849,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Consistent control of ADHD, able to focus without drastic drop off in evenings.;",10,
850,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"LOVE IT. I took Strattera for 4 yrs but switched because of terrible nausea and anxiety. The first 3 months I had terrible migraines, lack of appitite & trouble sleeping. Keep taking it daily to give body time to adjust. No side effects now and huge HUGE improvement in work, concentration and motivation.;",10,
851,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Works great for me.;,10,
852,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 18 years old and just graduated high school, all of my life I have had issues with going to school and getting things done. Always had great grades the first months of the school year then they would drop to C's, D's or failing. I was put on Vyvanse 1 day before my 18th birthday and it completely changed my life. Not only am I a much happier person, but I actually take interest in things and like finishing things I start! I have noticed some weight loss, but my appetite is and always will be still there. I'd really love to thank whoever discovered the wonderful prescription Vyvanse!;",10,
853,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Love this medicine! Tried all the others, Vyvanse definitely works the best. I stay on task, focused, more organized and been moving up in my field. 29 yr old female, 30mg dose. The only negative is if I don't take it for a day or 2 on the weekends then start again is at first it makes me real jittery and makes me go to the bathroom until my bowels are essentially cleaned out, but that's really not a bad thing. Also I love the way it curbs my appetite and keeps me around 115 lbs without even trying(I'm 5'3""""). A very pleasant side effect!! I was on 70 mg a couple years ago but I was getting a little too skinny(stable around 106-108 lbs), so decreased the dosage.;",10,
854,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I am 19 and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in elementary school. I have had my fair share of ADD/ADHD drugs that I have liked or disliked. For years I had been taking Concerta but I felt like it didn't do much for me. My grades started slipping during my sophmore year in high school and I decided that enough was enough. So I did some research and started reading about Vyvanse. My doctor didn't know much about it because it is a fairly new drug. I started taking 50mg of Vyvanse when I was 18 and have seen nothing but positive effects. I went from a 3.0 to a 4.1 GPA. It only lasts for about 5-6 hours so my doctor perscribed 5mg of Adderall to take. I have loads of studying to do. This drug is simply wonderful. The reviews are helpful.;,10,
855,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I started taking this my senior year in high school, and after 6 months on it, my GPA has come up at least 1 point! I take it during the week, and I have no problems with headaches or loss of appetite, and it helps wake me up and keep me up. I love it!;",10,
856,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,As an adult I love the fact that I don't have to plan my day around when I was going to take my next dose. With Vyvanse I take it in the morning and it lasts all day. When my 7 year old began taking medication during kindergarten it worked well but in first grade you are there all day. He was going to need second dose for an afternoon boost. Now that he is on Vyvanse I don't have to worry about making sure he is given his second dose by the school nurse. He just takes on in the morning and it lasts all day. I am also impressed by how the medicine eases into you system. There are no ups and downs.;,10,
857,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 17 year old high school student. I am very active, I play football, wrestle, and run track. I had always known that I wasn't stupid or anything, but I just didn't feel like applying myself. I started taking Vyvanse after the first marking period of grading my JR. I had 2 E's, 1 D-, 1 C, 1B and 1A- (weight Lifting). So finally my mother took me to go get checked out and I was indeed ADHD. The first day I took it, I felt like I was on top of the world. I had turned in almost ALL makeup work, like I had to be doing something productive at all times. My next Grading Period Grades were all A's. My whole football team and wrestling team could not believe it. I felt so good about myself, I am on 70 mg because I burn a lot off.;",10,
858,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This medicine has changed my life. I am a 43 year old female, diagnosed as an adult with ADHD. I always knew I was meant for more than what I seemed capable of achieving - although I would by no means consider myself an underachiever. The statement """"you don't know what you don't know"""" rings so true for me. Immediately upon starting this prescription my world changed. I was able to fully complete tasks, stay on schedule, CONCENTRATE, and prioritize...the list goes on and on. I wish I had a """"before and after"""" photo of my home. The clutter, disorganization, and chaos is gone. My house very much symbolizes my brain. I feel like my mind has been freed from the """"fog"""", and I am able to accomplish so much more now with much less stress.;",10,
859,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse changed my life for the better. I've been taking it for almost 2 years now and I honestly don't know where my life would be headed or where I'd end up without it, but looking at the direction it was going in before I got diagnosed with ADD, I wouldn't have gone far and probably ended up as a loser. I can finally read a book and know what I read or do my homework on my own! Since this medication; I stopped making stupid choices, went from D's to all B's. It helped my depression and it changed my life dramatically. My relationship with my friends and family has grown stronger. Before Vyvanse I pictured my future as a druggy, now I have a job and I am looking forward to becoming a vet.;",10,
860,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,This medication has increased my school performance greatly! I have experienced the weight loss and lower libido ALOT. But overall it's really great. I needed to lose weight anyway...;,10,
861,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 17 years old and i have been taking vyvanse for 4 years now and i take 70mg. It works so well but the side effects are awful. My back, neck, and wrists hurt and i can't fall asleep and i have killer head aches and i have shortness of breath and i become socially awkward. Like typically im a very sociable person but when i take my meds i don't talk.;",10,
862,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have ADD not ADHD.. I'm not hyper.. But, my grades were so low I barley had a chance of passing my sophomore year, but I noticed I had such a hard time concentrating all these years and always just tried forcing myself to concentrate but it never really did work.. So we went and got tested and I had a lot of tests done on me and my brain, actually.. And the hypothalamus in my brain was not working correctly and was not sending many signals to my nervous system.. And that was the cause of ADD.. My doctor then prescribed my Vyvanse and the first day I was on it I was overly concentrated and very mixed up... My eyes felt huge and I felt like I was tripping to be honest.. But after I got used to it I got 80s and 90s in my classes and passed:);",10,
863,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"40mg Vyvanse kept me awake all day, however, from the moment I took the 30mg dose I could stay awake and focused for 12 hours strait and still sleep at night. If I had this medicine in High School my life today would be 100% different. I would have excelled in academics and done much better sports. ;",10,
864,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I work in a call center and I was made aware of my hyperness and also that I was speaking way too fast to our customers on the phone. In reality I always knew I was a bit loud with my voice and with my actions. I was diagnosed with ADHD and placed on Vyvanse and to my surprise my world changed I am able to focus not just at work but in my life as well. I feel like every thing has been placed in order. Things make sence to me and I love the feeling. I am glad to have this medication in my life, and I don't see myself as ever going back to living the way I was.;",10,
865,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,If you have social anxiety don't take more than 40 milligrams of Vyvanse because you'll be extremely anxious. I'd also suggest taking 0.25 milligrams of Klonopin in the afternoon to help with the moodiness and anxiety amphetamines cause as they wear off.;,10,
866,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This medication has done wonders for my son. He's been on it now for about 2years, and it really helps him concentrate in school and at home. Last year he brought home a's and b's and hes 9 years old! I am so proud of him!;",10,
867,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a junior in high school who was just diagnosed with both severe ADD and ADHD. I go to a pretty good high school where I achieved around a 3.2 last year (generally get a 3.6 but last semester of my sophomore year I got like a 2.7). After I got on Vyvanse my GPA went up to around a 4.0 and I am in mostly honors and AP classes. Although I was always thought to be smart and nobody ever denied that, they would say I was lazy and unorganized and simply didn't apply myself. Now I get A's without effort, my teachers love me, I hardly have to pay attention, and I also have a love for school/my subjects that I didn't have before. I am now excited to go to school and function on a much higher level. I would most definitely recommend Vyvanse.;",10,
868,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been able to focus so much more, I feel like my life is back in order. I'm able to do things that I would struggle with in the past. Some of the feelings in my body are numb when I do the activities, which is different. All my anxiety is gone. I don't feel hungry often, and I randomly crash for sleep. This is only the second day on it, so I'll see what happens next.;",10,
869,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I adore Vyvanse. It totally improves my quality of life keeping me energized, making me think more clearly and putting me in the happiest mood ever. Different medications work better for different people, but I very highly recommend Vyvanse.;",10,
870,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"So far so good, I recently started Vyvanse and it has been wonderful I am really seeing a difference. The only side effect I have experienced is dry mouth and I did not drink enough water anyway so I have had a very positive experience.;",10,
871,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I took a 30 mg dose of Vyvanse and it helped me focus all day. I feel much less depressed and have not noticed any nervous side effects. I have read that it makes sleeping difficult and will find out tonight. I like it.;,10,
872,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 23 and have tried just about every ADHD medication out there. I've been on Vyvanse for some time now and it's great! I have energy, I can focus at work and school. It lasts the entire day and then some. The only drawback is you won't eat. You'll be hungry your stomach will growl but you can't eat. Sleeping is tough because it's a stimulant so I was put on sleep meds to help. You might have a jittery feeling and increased heart rate at first. It takes about an hour or so to kick in but it's a fantastic medicine. It's also very powerful. All you gotta do is NOT take it past 2pm at absolute LATEST or you'll lie awake forever in bed. Eat prior to ingesting because you won't eat later. It's great, try it!;",10,
873,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 11 and I take it. Before I got in trouble a lot, but now I'm fine.;",10,
874,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 11 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD inattentive in August 2010 and we tried Concerta 36mg and it did nothing. The pediatrician prescribed Vyvanse 40mg to start, and what a difference! My son can now listen, focus, pay attention, concentrate at home and at school and can better manage his behaviors, thoughts and words. We are very happy with the results. He didn't lose appetite or weight, and has no side effects thus far. We are more than happy to have found a prescription that works for him so that he can function normally on a day to day basis.;",10,
875,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse changed my son's behavior even the first day, and he has taken Vyvanse daily for 2.5 years. He was six when he started. I also started taking Vyvanse, and just wish this had been around when I was a student.;",10,
876,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I've been using Vyvanse to treat my ADHD for about a month now and I have to say, I could feel the positive effects pretty much instantly. I've accomplished more in a month with this medicine than I had in a year prior to using it. The one issue I did encounter was an increase to my already existent problem with insomnia but having started taking Trazodone has counteracted this issue. It should be noted that not everyone has the same reaction to any given drug but as for me, nothing I've tried in the past has been NEAR as effective. A (Note: In comparison to other drugs I've tried similar to Vyvanse I've found that it gives me the benefits I need without the overwhelming tweaked out feeling that others caused for me);",10,
877,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been on ADD meds off and on for about 10 years. I'm 33 and before Vyvance I had tried Concerta and Adderrall. While the other two were ok, they did not benefit me nearly as much as Vyvance. In one semester I went from making a 50 on a College Algebra test to making a 100% on the comprehensive final. My professor said he had never seen anything like it, someone going from a 50 to 100. For the first time in my life I remembered to pay bills on time, I don't forget about the clothes in the washer for days, or forget to turn off the stove. I feel so much more accomplished!!;",10,
878,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Much better than Adderall that I've been taking for 12 years. My heart doesn't race, the dry mouth effects aren't nearly as intense. There are no more highs & lows! Love it.;",10,
879,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I'm 29. I was first diagnosed when I was in the second grade. I first started being medicated when I was 11. Doctors tried Ritalin and I was maxed out then I was switched to Desoxyn then Adderall as a pre-teen then Strattera and Effexer. I stopped taking my meds then after my father passed away I lost it and my mother had heard about NEW miracle ADHD medicine. She begged me to talk to my therapist about it. My therapist was on board as well so I mentioned it to my psych. I have been taking Vyvanse for 4 years. I wish it was around when I was a child. Growing up wouldn't have been so hard. Thank you so very much Vyvanse.;,10,
880,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse has been amazing for me. I used to take Adderall, which made me moody, self-conscious, unhappy with myself and life, and far from my true personality. I now take 70 mg Vyvanse and it has worked miracles. I feel I am my true self but with controlled ADHD symptoms. Now, when I need to concentrate, I am now able to thanks to Vyvanse.;",10,
881,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Vyvanse is amazing. I've had it for about 4 months now and it's worked better than any other medicine I've tried. I am able to focus on the stuff I am doing and am able to stick with a task. I highly recommend it.;,10,
882,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been on Vyvanse for almost 2 years and have had no major symptoms. I had dry mouth, but that pretty much subsided. I did lose about 30lbs, but I'm 5'9"""" and was weighing about 240lbs, so it wasn't as bad thing. I have ADHD, I started this medicine when I was almost 40. I'm almost 42 and really have had a great experience. My son is on it for ADD, and my daughter for ADHD. She was just tested and accepted into the gifted program and he is 2 years younger and has had significant improvements to his grades and behavior. I would recommend.;",10,
883,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This medication should be the #1 choice that doctors prescribe their patients. I have taken Concerta, Ritalin, Adderall XR, but none seem to work as well as Vyvanse, and with as little side effects. Your confidence, mood and energy may dramatically increase with Vyvanse, it truly is a magnificent medication.;",10,
884,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 60 years old and a career woman who has always struggled with completing tasks despite working long hours. Had recently succombed to depression and loss of self esteem because I was feeling I was no longer capable of performing my job because of age. Suffered this feeling most of my life, been in therapy and was usually prescribed antidepressants or SSRI inhibitors to treat my symptoms but never cause of my symptoms. I did not even know adults could suffer from ADD. FINALLY a therapist took the time to treat the cause of my lifelong struggle instead of merely sedating me. MY LIFE HAS CHANGED!! MY JOB PERFORMANCE AND PERSONAL LIFE HAS IMPROVED. I ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THINGS. Why so late in life?;",10,
885,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I really want parents to take a good look at what they may be about to give their children before they do so. If dopamine deficient; Vyvanse will initially appear to be amazing. Until a """"tolerance"""" is built up when it will leave a person feeling as low/moody and agitated as they ever have. Recent studies indicate that mood disorders may mask themselves as ADD/ADHD. If you or your child is experiencing any of the major or severe emotional side effects of this or other stimulants; please consider that it could be mood disorders brought on by a dopamine deficiency. This is what happened to me and because I was aware of the symptoms of dependency and mood disorder, I recognized it immediately.;",10,
886,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son has been taking the medication for a week on Tuesday and all I have to say is that he is doing a lot better. His teacher noticed a difference on the first day, so did my son. He stated to me that he can actually focus on lessons and listen to the lesson with no problem. The only thing that I can say is that my son said that he doesn't want to eat as much but he eats anyway because he knows he needs to and at night he wakes up once. The doctor did tell us that, that may happen in the beginning but that it will ware off.;",10,
887,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 17 and been on Vyvance for about two years. I had always had a really hard time paying attention in class and getting any kind of work done, so my mom took me to the Dr and he diagnosed me with severe ADD. He put me on Strattera and I was good on it, until they upped my dosage. I'm normally a really happy, easy going person, do not get mad easily AT ALL, but on the Strattera, I was moody and was having nightmares, couldn't sleep. So he put me on Ritalin. It was the same as the Strattera, moody, nightmares, and the added increased heart rate. So finally, the Dr said he was going to try Vyvanse. I was really scared because of the past experiences, but I tried it. I slept, felt good, and am able to focus!;",10,
888,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 45 years old with 2 sons with ADHD. I've always known that I also have ADHD, but it wasn't officially diagnosed until 2 months ago. My doctor put me on an escalating dose of Vyvanse, starting at 30mg and upped to 50mg. I am so glad I finally sought treatment and my physician prescribed this medication. I can read something and pay attention to the words I am reading for the first time in my whole life. I don't have to re-read and re-read until I can concentrate on the words. My thoughts are much more organized, and I don't feel like a spinning top. I have not experienced any negative side-effects, and I am sleeping better. I know that others have had some bad effects with this drug, but it is a miracle medicine for me.;",10,
889,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This medication has changed my life. I didn't start taking it until I was 24 years old. I honestly thought it was hopeless trying to figure out my life. I kept failing college courses, struggled with my job, struggled with relationships. I genuinely thought I was stupid. Sounds dramatic, but that's honestly I how I felt. I just couldn't think or concentrate. Then I tried Vyvanse. I was really against stimulants or any type of drug that could be addictive. But, I'm SO grateful I tried it. I wouldn't be where I am today without it. I'm a nursing student with a 4.0. I have an amazing relationship and I enjoy my job. It's not a miracle drug, but it really helps me focus and do the things I know I can do. Definitely recommend it.;",10,
890,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 16 and I've taken Vyvanse for months now and it helps a lot with minimal side effects. My mouth does get dry and I become less social but other than that its preferable to Ritalin, as Ritalin is much less smooth in terms of kicking in and wearing off and lasts a lot shorter.;",10,
891,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 20 years old and just started taking this medication because I was having trouble in school wrapping my head around the massive amount of data we have to learn at school. I have noticed a HUGE improvement on my comprehension while reading in my book, and much more interested and focused on everything my instructor says during the period of class time, and I actually remember it. It helps me complete my projects in school and stay focused on one task instead of walking around aimlessly wasting time seeing what everyone else is doing and saying """"I can just do that tomorrow, or later on."""" I can finally sit down and get things done the way I should be. No crashing at the end of the day, or jitteriness.;",10,
892,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I wouldn't typically give any drug such a high rating, but Vyvanse has truly changed my life with few if any side effects. I take 20 mg once a day, and it lasts 12 to 14 hours. It took about 2 weeks of trial and error to find the dosage, but it was very worthwhile. I am happier, less anxious, and significantly more organized than I have ever been. I am a student and many areas of my life--academics, social functioning, general health, etc.--have all improved greatly. The inattentive fog has cleared, and I finally feel able to create the life I want to be living. Better control over my life has also given me back self-esteem and stabilized my moods.

The loss of appetite effect has been very welcome with growing older (I am 46). I have struggled with a sedentary lifestyle and my weight kept increasing. Since taking Vyvanse I have lost 50lbs and that has helped my sleep apnea to the point that I feel much better in the morning and I am not at the same weight I was when I got married 17 years ago. I am 200 lbs 6'1"""" and have worked up from the initial 10Mg dosage to the max now at 70Mg. I have been on Vyvanse for about a year and a half.;",10,
895,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Incredible. I was on Adderall for over a year. My doctor switched me to Vyvanse four days ago. Since day one, I have felt better than ever. That """"nervous-jittery feeling"""" (perfect description) as well as anxiety and teeth-grinding that I had while on Adderall is totally gone. I feel """"normal"""". I am able to concentrate and focus calmly, and am no longer plagued by excessive energy. I feel healthy, and everyone around me has noticed the positive difference in such a short amount of time.;",10,
896,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse has changed my life, for the better. It gives me the motivation and confidence I need to complete tasks that otherwise would be daunting and unappealing. Talk to your doctor first to make sure you actually would benefit from it. The only down side is how expensive it can get if you're not covered.;",10,
897,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have a son that has struggled with an attention problem in school since kindergarden. He is now 11 years old. We tried everything not to put him on medication. The homework struggle and impulsiveness became too much for us to handle, and we finally agreed to try something. His doctor told us about a new ADHD medication called Vyvanse. Believe this or not, it was like magic the first day. He was able to get all his work done in class, and went from a A,B,C student to all A's and one B in one quarter. We have the report cards to prove it. The side effects are minimal and for him the 30mg works great. I encourage anyone battling this problem to ask their childs doctor about Vyvanse. It has changed by sons life as well as ours.;",10,
898,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been talking Vyvanse for just a week. 40mg. The first 3 days I couldn't sit down. I cleaned my house and my parents. Not just cleaned but extra clean, like walls and moving furniture and everything. But now it has faded a little. I noticed right away that when I am doing stuff, its like I really concentrate and try perfection for everything. My appetite has been curved, but I still eat. But no where like I did before. So far I lost 4pds. It's been almost a week. I don't get any feeling of jitters, or that I'm taking speed. I feel normal, I just want to do stuff. I'm more social. I always stayed in my home, but now I just want to go out. It's very nice feeling. I have no problems sleeping either, but I also take it as soon as I wake up;",10,
899,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was on Ritalin/Concerta since I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 6 (I am now 18). I switched to Strattera last September, and that was horrible, didn't do a thing for my ADHD. I went back on Concerta, but noticed it wasn't working as well. My psychiatrist switched me to Vyvanse 40mg in the morning, and I immediately noticed the benefits, 100% better than Concerta and 400000% better than Strattera. Only side effects is lack of appetite but I am welcoming that side effect because I also suffer from binge eating disorder. It helps my concentration immensely (I suffer with severe ADHD, to the point it's hard to have a conversation without zoning out and not listening). Vyvanse is a life saver!;",10,

As an adult in college- I got made fun of in good humor by friends about how much I studied. I couldn't concentrate, remember, mind wander and jump to something else & hyper. Tried Adderall instant and XR. My husband said both made me mean and irritable. Plus I lost 10 pounds before our wedding (already underweight). It increased my anxiety, I hated it. My psychiatrist switched me to Vyvanse 30mg. Wow! No mood swings, no appetite changes, can concentrate, less anxiety because it evens me out. I feel alive and normal!;",10,
901,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 24 year old recovering alcoholic and drug addict, I've been misdiagnosed by many doctors, been on several medications such as lithium and prozac (which I reacted horribly too and sometimes ended up in a psych hospitals) as a result of those misdiagnosis and I was untreated for ADHD my entire life since I was first diagnosed at the age of 9. I've been on Vyvanse for over a year now under the direction of a new doctor/addiction specialist and this medication has CHANGED MY LIFE. It has made me more focused and productive, more motivated, less hyper, less anxious; it has also CURED my insomnia. This is the real me: balanced, organized, articulate, focused and productive. So happy a doctor finally got my diagnosis right.;",10,
902,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I love Vyvanse. It helps me concentrate and helps me in school to work faster and harder. When I get home I immediately start homework and then I just chill with the family until bedtime when I'm tired. I did have insomnia but that went away within about a week. Now I sleep like a baby again and it helped me finally start working out which I have been planning to do for almost 2 months now. Also, I went from struggling to get D's to easily making A's in all classes. I recommend this medicine.;",10,
903,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I am 45 and was diagnosed with ADD & dyslexia when i was a child. Didn't know about it until i was 40. Tried many other meds and would highly recommend Vyvanse. The best part is not having the nervous-jittery feeling. I don't realize I am on it during the day. I am glad my doctor recommended it to me.;,10,

Held him back in first that helped a little. Then third grade about killed him. Medications were my last resort. Scared me to death to put him on medicines, 100% difference. Teacher said it was like a fog lifted. I'm like wow. Decreased appetite only side affect. But not bad.;",10,
905,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I am 20 years old and have been on Vyvanse 50mg for about 4 months now. I find this medication has helped me a lot. I've tried others but nothing can compare to this. I never finished high school but since I started taking Vyvanse I have switched my life around. I started school and am making high marks. This medication has changed my life for the better.;,10,
906,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I found this medication very effective, I am able to stay on task without changing my mood, speak clearer without getting tongue tied and I do eat smaller portion than I usually do. I've only lost 5lbs the max within two year and the only side affect I have is occasional dry mouth. It's best to stay hydrated and eat a snack in between meals while on this medication to reduce the dry mouth it works for me.;",10,

Fortunately I am an entrepreneur and have employees because I do not feel I could have ever held down a job. I have been taking Vyvanse for a week and my entire life has changed - I am getting my work done, I am happier, have less stress and anxiety about not getting things done and for the first time in my life I am able to sit and accomplish a task without getting frustrated, distracted and putting things off. AMAZING!;",10,
908,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 13 years old I've been on Vyvanse for about 7 years. It really helps me focus and concentrate on things that are important, it also helps me know when and when not to do things like talk when some one else is talking.;",10,

In the first week I was using Vyvanse I noticed a huge difference in everything. I could focus so much more on every thing. Comparing my 1st semester and 2nd semester of high school last year, I had an F and failed one class and had mostly B's and C's. My second semester of last school year when I started taking the Vyvanse my grades increased amazingly. Almost all A's and B's. Since I suffer from ADD, Vyvanse has made such a great impact on my life.;",10,
911,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse is hands down, in my opinion, the best ADHD medication out there. I was on Concerta from the ages of 7-13, then again from 20-21. I received genetic testing and it came back that my body doesn't metabolize Concerta very well. So the doctor gave me Adderall, which was too harsh with the come up and come down. Then made the switch to Vyvanse. Best decision. #1. You don't crash when you are on it. It has the smoothest come up and come down compared to Adderall and Concerta. #2. Vyvanse lasts a good 10-14 hours in the body #3. It has the longest duration of action #4. It has low addiction potential #5. It also is the only one that helps manage my binge eating disorder;",10,
912,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I have been taking this medicine since i was in the 6th grade! I am now 22 years old. This medicine made me feel like i could actually sit in class with out falling asleep or not being able to concentrate. It's a great feeling to actually get everything done. Yes it does cause dry mouth and you may not eat like you used to. However you have to make yourself eat something other wise you can cause your blood sugar to drop witch would cause headach and nausea. With time you do get used to the medicine and you will get your appitite back. I'm on 50mg. On days i dont take it im like a walking zombie i dont feel like doing anything i cant concentrate and i will most likely eat all day long. I'm more activie when i do take it! I love it !;,10,

914,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"We couldn't be more pleased with this medication. My 9 year old son was previously on Concerta and Metadate CD. Although those medications were effective, Vyvanse has greatly out performed both. The most significant side effect has been lack of appetite. We encourage a late meal so that he can make up for what he has missed throughout the day. His weight seems to be holding steady following an initial weight loss of 6 pounds. This is a medication worth trying!;",10,
915,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I feel like the character in the movie """"Limitless"""" because I have been responding extremely well with this medicine! It is known that medicine works different for everyone, but for me it's a God send and I only take 20 mg. I have always had a tough time comprehending everything even talking. I have to focus on what I'm saying to make less grammar mistakes and sometimes I do sound slow. Vyvanse has enhanced my comprehension: I can now do math quicker, enjoy reading and listening, and actually talk like a normal person. I feel happy and energetic. Sounds too good to be true, but I consider myself lucky. No adverse side effects yet. ;",10,
916,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,This drug is the best thing. I have more energy. Can do more things and my mind is not thinking 100 things at once.;,10,
917,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son is on Vyvanse, now so am I. First, my head is clear for the first time ever. No 90 mile an hour uncontrollable though, no wondering ideas, no day dreaming. I don't feel drugged. In fact, I feel drugged when I'm not on medicines now. I didn't know what it was like to be """"normal"""" prior to this medicine. The only issue I have is the stomach problems. Some slight stomach pain and bowel issues. I also stopped drinking caffeine and have adjusted my diet to be more well balanced. It's helped a lot. If you're new to Vyvanse, don't drink caffeine! Water only, and adjust your diet for high protein in the morning, it's a must. Change your diet and quick.;",10,
918,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 8 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD when he started Kindergarten. It was horrible. His doctor put him on Focalin XR. It worked pretty good, it definitely calmed him down and helped him concentrate in class. But after a while I noticed his appetite decreased immensely and he started losing weight. So in April of 08` his doctor switched him to Vyvanse and it is amazing. His appetite is normal, he's doing very well in school, and he's making lots of friends. Our lives have changed for the better thanks to Vyvanse.;",10,
919,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Just started taking Vyvanse. Before I was taking Adderall 30mg XR and I'll tell you Vyvanse works so much better. Vyvanse stays active until it wears off. The only bad part is, sometimes it will stop working for like 5 minutes and then it will start working wonders again. It helps me get my work done and it helps me stay in control and very focused all day long while I'm working. Before I started taking Vyvanse I couldn't concentrate what so ever. And I would never get my work done. It also makes me feel the best that I have ever felt in my whole life. If it wasn't for Vyvanse I would probably be fired. I'm 24 and I finally get to enjoy life. To the people who made Vyvanse god bless you.;",10,

At first it took me a couple weeks to find out what worked for me (when to take it, eat first or after etc.). My grades at the time were horrible and they went up after I started taking Vyvanse. I have had a few of the side effects (dry mouth, loss of appetite, weight loss etc.) but this medication helps me focus a lot more.;",10,
924,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,It works. Less is better anything over 15-20 mg makes me too focused.;,10,
925,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Last year my oldest daughter who is now 9yrs old was diagnosed with ADD and the doctor put her on Aderrall but within a week took her off and right away put her on Vyvanse 30mg. It worked perfect for a while but now have to get her dosage raised because it wears off after only a few hours although the upside is that her grades have improved tremendously and now I also have an 8 yr old who was also diagnosed with ADHD and is also taking Vyvanse 30 mg and I've noticed a real positive change in her concentration and her mood. I love it because she is also doing so much better in school.;,10,
926,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 28 years old. I'm a cook in an extremely fast paced, high profile kitchen needless to say celebritys love to have their weddings there. When I take my Vyvanse I can cook at a 100% capacity for the whole 8 hrs. Laser focused, good mood, feel I can do another 300 covers after we're done, don't need any help in the line. It's just wow. If you work in a place where you're under high pressure and quality is demanded this is your drug. I've always had ADD since I was small. My mother was too negligent to do anything about it I was a failure in high school and it really sucked. I would read things and be like """" what?"""" Lol I was bad now I take 60mg I take one around 1pm to help me through my work.;",10,
927,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Ok, to begin with: Vyvanse has dramatically improved my life. I am a 20 year old college student and I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19. I have always been a bright student, cheerful person and an overall hard worker but Vyvanse has """"improved"""" me. I feel that it allows me to monitor and control my thoughts and actions in a way I never seemed to be able to before. Effects I experience from Vyvanse: Improved concentration, ability to focus clearly on a subject or task at hand, ability to switch focus and not """"obsess"""", improvements in grades, & ability to plan/schedule/prioritize activities. In the end I feel like Vyvanse has made the dream me reality, I can finally accomplish my goals.;",10,
928,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,GREAT ADHD medication. ask for financial help. they give 12 month card that takes half off the cost of Vyvanse... take as directed.;,10,
929,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Wow what a difference maker. I am a young Male (30ish) and have found that Vyvanse has been such a life changer. I am gettiing so much more done at work. When I go home at night I find myself enjoying my time with my children more. I am not getting the crash effect I was experiencing with other medicines. That reason alone is so worth it. I have not had any side effects, well maybe minor dry mouth, but it last me 12-13 hours. It is truly an awesome medication. I would recommend it.;",10,
930,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My daughter is 8 and has tried other medicines for ADHD. I did not like them because of the side effects, she was like a zombie. With the Vyvanse, I don't notice a major change in her personality. AND, she is focusing better in school. Much better grades. I love this medicine because she still acts like MY DAUGHTER and not some alien.;",10,
931,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I am 19 now and started taking ADD medicines when I was 17. I had used Adderall for a few months and had to stop because of the 'rebound' I got from it. It made me too agitated and easily angry/sad when coming down on it near the end of the day. I switched to Focalin XR and it worked well for maybe another month before the same thing started happening. My doctor then wanted to try one more time so he said there is a newer stimulant out for ADD/ADHD and it is pretty much like a cousin of Adderall. He said there is a better chance that this won't have a negative rebound. I have been on 60mg of Vyvanse for a few months and I have not felt any type of negative side-effects like I had before. It works great and helps me stay focused with school and work.;,10,
932,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Very strong. The best ADHD medication.;,10,
933,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have tried typing a response and recommendation for this medication but keep running out of space. In short, this drug absolutely changed my life. As adults, we all remember certain days in our life, i.e., our first kiss, graduation, birth of a child, getting married, etc. I will always remember Saturday, December 8, 2007 as the day where my life changed because of Vyvanse. The only side effect for me was a complete loss of appetite for about a month. But in my case, that's not such a bad thing! I was taking 50mg for about 6 months and now have taken 70mgs for the last 16 months.;",10,
934,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 43 yo mom of 2 (3 if you count my husband). I can't stress enough how much Vyvanse has completely changed my life. I was diagnosed with ADD after my oldest received her diagnosis about 10 yrs ago. I've tried Adderall, Concerta, & the like and even on high doses, NEVER experienced the clarity & energy I've gotten on just 20mg of Vyvanse. I've just started taking it 2 weeks ago & wish I had discovered this medicine years ago! The only issue is that this week I titrated up to 30mg and have noticed some irritability, so I think I'll go back to the lower dose. Love, love, LOVE my new lease on life thanks to Vyvanse!;",10,
935,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I cannot stress enough how thankful I am for this medication. I had always been a very smart kid but my drive and focus would come in very short bursts if I was interested otherwise I could not have cared less. I was prescribed 30mg of Vyvanse initially and that was upped to 50mg which I have been taking for over a year now. My grades went from a 3.2 GPA to a 4.0 within a semester. I excelled at work. I am a more alert driver. Like everyone else has said, I feel as if my thoughts are all organized the way they always should have been and I am finally able to catch up on life, which always seemed out of reach. I strongly prefer this medication over Adderall IR which I tried. There are no negative side effects except insomnia.;",10,
936,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was eleven. Over the years, I've been on Metadate, Strattera, Ritalin, Adderall, and Concerta. Finally, after a couple years of a break from the medications (nothing worked before), my new doctor decided to put me on Vyvanse (30mg). Within the first few hours of taking this drug, I noticed improvement. My mind didn't feel clouded, I could remember things, I could finish tasks, and I was not easily distracted like before. He added Depakote(125mg) to my regimen, which is supposed to assist with agitation and anxiety. Together, these drugs have tremendously improved my life. The only """"bad"""" things I have noticed is that my appetite is almost gone and I talk A LOT more than I used to.;",10,
937,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 21 and currently suffering from ADD and Depression. The Vyvanse has done wonders for me! I can finally concentrate.

938,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,This is the third medicine my daughter has been on this year. Although the other two worked for her ADHD the side effects where not very great.

Taking 30 mgs and don't want to increase. Sometimes will take a break on weekends like this weekend. Really helps with focus, memory and energy level. I don't notice any side effects. Hasn't effected sleep. I take at about 6:30 AM and it wears off by afternoon. It is pretty expensive because insurance doesn't cover and have to visit Dr. every month. If you are older and in good health and have ADD symptoms I suggest you look into this. Your body adjusts to it over the first couple months. The first time you take it you feel euphoric but that is not what you want. Keep taking small dose.;",10,
940,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I started taking this pill and immediately noticed the difference. My life literally changed the moment I took the first pill. While I suffered from uncontrollable speech the first 2 days but my body adjusted. I started with 50mg and I now take 70mg. I am 23 years old. Some other side effects I have experienced are decreased sexual drive, loss of weight and appetite. However, I can concentrate on anything. This pill has taken the characteristic of lazy out of me. I am more productive than ever.;",10,

I dont need to go into all his symptoms because he has so many and wish I did not wait so long to wake up and smell the coffee (if you know what I mean). Anyway I went to the Doctor and after all my research I asked the doc (I am a nurse by the way) if we could try Vyvanse and he said yes, that is after he determined that """"Yes"""" he has ADHD. The first week back at school (after break) the teachers could not believe the change in him. In Algebra(before medicine) he was flunking all his tests and today he sent me a text that he got his first """"A"""". The knowledge was all there, it just needed help to be released.;",10,

If you've ever watched the movie limitless, that's exactly how it feels! There was this short period of time that I took a break every now and then, do not do that! It made me chronically bipolar but I've started up on it and it really is the best medication you could have. If you wish to get off of it, I suggest you do so slowly and on days you don't have it, drink caffeine. It took me 6 months to not have that addictive feeling, now I'm back on it because I'm going back to school. It's up to you to say whether the side effects out way the epic benefits. It took me a while to figure that out. Good Luck!;",10,

(Over the course of about 10 years) i talked to my regular doctor and nothing, psychologists were worthless. After seeing a psychiatrist he prescribed me 30 mg of vyanese to take in the morning.

Today after my first pill I just realized that in a normal condition my brain was only working at only 20% of its full capacity when studying, reading, driving or even in sexual relation (I had erectile dysfunction) and today with the pill I just felt invincible and in a super good mood (not understanding what you're studying or simply reading is just depressing).

He just couldn't concentrate or stay on task. Reading was a nightmare and he was barely managing to pass. We were scared of trying any medicines but are so glad that we did. He did experience a few side effects such as headaches and nausea the first few days, but those have passed. Most important, he is still my son, no zombies. Homework is easy and his teacher already reports better grades. I encourage any parent to at least try this medicine. It has improved our quality of life even. We have more time for fun stuff and I don't have to nag him constantly to do his normal chores. They get done the first time.;",9,
952,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My 11 year old son just started taking Vyvanse 1 month ago and I can already see the differences in his grades.

Downside - upset stomach if I dont make him eat right after taking it. So on our way out the door we have a vyvanese and a Trail Mix bar to coat the stomach. He gets a full 7 hours.;,9,
953,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 20 year old college student and have been taking Vyvanse for about 6 months now. Honestly, I love this medication, as it has helped me in almost every aspect of life. My grades as well as my confidence in social situations are better than ever. The only slightly annoying side effect that hasn't gone away is that I find my mouth sometimes getting extremely dry. Sometimes I'll notice that my breath smells funny as a result, and I find myself going through a lot of gum and breath mints, and even brushing my teeth randomly throughout the day. Overall though, Vyvanse has been a miracle for me.;",9,
954,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I posted a couple of months ago...but wanted to post again since I've been on Vyvanse a little longer and have more to share. I'm a 40 year old woman.This medication has changed my life and I can't say enough positive things about it. My doctor and I were discussing it last night and he said that not everyone has the success that I've had on it...everyone is different. I take 70mg and it does last all day. No bad side effects except I've lost 15lbs, so I must watch that. Also..dry mouth. Otherwise, Vyvanse gets the highest marks with me. For bad PMS..I take Lithium for 7 days prior to start of period..and that keeps the """"meanies"""" away. :);",9,
955,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been on Vyvanse for over a year, started at 20mg then 30,40,50 and decided 40mg was perfect for me. I am a college student and have always had undiagnosed ADHD. MY grades in high school were mostly C's and B's. After being on Vyvanse my grades went up. It was weird because I felt more over-stimulated Adderall type buzz/high feeling at 20 and 30mgs. I liked that feeling but I was having side effects like lack of sleep. I actually then upped my dose to 50mgs. Around that time I was holding 2 jobs and studying full time, 6 college classes. The 40 and 50mg actually made me feel more normal as if I wasn't taking anything except my mind was focused. I lacked side effects and everything was perfect. My grades are now 3.5GPA thanks to Vyvanse.;",9,
956,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse has worked great for me. Before I started taking the medication I was like a walking zombie. I was zoned out about 90% of the day. Since I have started Vyvanse I can tell a huge difference and so can my family and friends. They say that I am more talkative and a great listener now and that I also seem much happier. The only downfall of this medication is some of the side effects, as in loss of appetite and sometimes I get headaches. I think I can deal with the side effects.;",9,
957,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"After being diagnosed with ADHD when I was eleven and being on Adderall XR for nine years I have to say Vyvanse is the best thing that has happened to me. The last year in college Adderall made me anxious, suspicious, and generally unhappy. So after several trials with Ritalin and Cymbalta, I am proud to say that I am doing much better on Vyvanse and my grades were awesome this semester. Two A's, two B's and a C! Much better than two B's and three C's. I am on 40mg of Vyvanse. I did lose 20lbs during the first two months but I gained it back. I also do have some trouble eating in the afternoons but when the medicine wears off, which I never notice haha, I am able to eat quite a bit of food. Overall, Vyvanse is an amazing choice.;",9,
958,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have suffered from ADD/ADHD for all my life. I am currently 23 years old. I was on vyvanse (40 mgs, I am extremely sensitive to pills). I have tried about 5 different stimulant type medicines. Vyvanse really changed my life. I was able to transition from the food service industry to a Real Estate career. I got Mono, and had to stop the medicine while my body recovered. I really liked the way i felt off it. But i now feel as though my life is unmanageable. I don't like the feeling of being medicated so young with out any proof of long term effects, but i feel like i am drowning. I feel alone in my ADHD because its not something that people feel sympathetic toward. Vyvanse really changed that feeling.;",9,
959,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 25 yr old woman, I've been on Vyvanse for about 1.5-2 yrs and I have had a great experience with it. I've always been a bright student and done pretty well in school, I got by in high school but found myself struggling in college. I got diagnosed with ADHD, tried Strattera, tried Concerta to no effect. New doctor suggested Vyvanse, I started at a 30 mg, I'm up to 70 mg a day but have been steady on that dose for at least a year. It has decreased my appetite, but I also started p90x not long after I started taking this drug so I'm not sure which is more responsible for my weight loss. Besides that, no real side effects just helps me focus and concentrate on whatever I am supposed to be doing (and not just daydream).;",9,
960,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"We switched on the advice of the then new ADHD therapist. It took longer to """"kick in"""" and build up than other meds we tried but it has been a God send. His grades are WAY up and he's not as hot or cold as he used to be. My only issues are he won't eat while on it...not even a tiny bite. Dr is keeping an eye on the weight. Also, to me, he's not himself. I don't like the flatness because his personality is so big! At least it wears off!;",9,
961,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have always done well in school, but my time management, organizational skills, motivation, and overall thought/idea clarity have lacked. I went back to college at 29 to finish 2 year degree, and decided to finish 4 year while I am at it. I was diagnosed with ADHD this past fall, and put on Adderall IR then XR, then back to IR because it just didn't work that well, and quite frankly it made me too anxious at times. Dr. at school just put me on 30 mg of Vyvanse as an alternative to Adderall, and it works very well. I worry about drug interactions but it works great and I'm incredibly focused on my everyday tasks with this medication.;",9,

Decided to run my life without it and did well for a while til i became 25. As you get older adhd changes and involves more depression emotion and anger while still keeping your energy level and craziness. Vyvanse was prescribbed at a low dose and it is CLEARLY night and day on it.. Emotions are manageable and mind is clear.. One thought at a time. The lights in our mind do go out a tad. Its not so exciting in your own head anymore but you do gain a sense of control that is with ADHD dont even know exists. Some dry mouth and it will keep you up at night if you take it too late. But thats to be expected from amphetamines. Some loss of appeti;,9,
963,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Works better than any other stimulant medicine I have tried. I have sensitivity to stimulants; it causes bruxism. The bruxism is absent with a 20 mg dose, and minimal with a 30 mg dose. Other Stimulants - I cannot take even the lowest dose without getting the bruxism side-effect to the point I can't stand it. Also, I can't """"feel"""" when it starts working and stops working - which is great. It wears off slowly starting about 7-8 hours after I take it. After 10-11 hours I do not feel it in my system anymore. No Insomnia or """"crashing feeling"""". Weight loss (ok since I am fat) about 25 lbs in 3 months. My only complaint is it makes me want to smoke. I quit smoking a long time ago. I think about wanting to have a cigarette several times a day.;",9,
964,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Our 8 yr old son was diagnosed with ADHD in Kindergarten. We tried everything. We left no stone unturned. We were referred to a great psychiatrist who listened to our concerns and advised us to start him on Vyvanse. He started in March 17. To say it has been a miracle is an understatement. While he is not yet a """"A"""" student, he can now work independently, is not as frustrated, his handwriting has improved. His teachers are amazed at the turn around. I am only writing a review because I had read all the blogs and was terrified to say the least. This med so far has worked with only a few side effects that we are working on.ie;increased agitation when coming off of. His happiness and ability to learn is worth it;",9,
965,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse is probably one of the more successful attempts by pharmaceutical companies to create a medication for ADD/ADHD that doesn't carry the negative repercussions other, older medications have, i.e. anxiety, anorexia, insomnia, etc. It's amazing.;",9,
966,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I am a high school student (10 grade). Today was my first day taking Vyvanse and I feel like a totally different person! I was very stressed about school because I couldn't concentrate and making bad grades isn't fun so it made me a little depressed. I noticed that I actually felt like doing work (never thought that would happen) and instead of finishing my episode of Teen mom 2 I was eager to do my homework instead! At night I got about an hour of sleep then was up for about 8 hours until it was time to go to school and I forgot to eat the whole day it's just food didn't sound good at all and it gave me so much energy especially because we had to run the mile at school and I ran it very fast because it changes your whole mindset.;,9,
967,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"At first I was a bit skeptical. This is my first time using any pill for ADHD. It took at least 2 hours to kick in, but when it did, I worked on 3 assignments non stop for 8 hours and my brain is still clicking. This really helped me!;",9,
968,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Best ADHD medication I have taken. All the pros of Adderall without the crash or mood swings. However sometimes if I haven't taken it for a few days, when I take it again I get horrible migraines at night.;",9,
969,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have had past drug abuse problems with Ritalin and adderall. My doc started me on 50mg of Vyvanse because of less opportunity for abuse. It works well and is nearly impossible to abuse. If you take more than the prescribed dose, you don't get the euphoric high that Ritalin and Adderall provides so there is no use to try to abuse it.;",9,
970,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I just started taking Vyvanse today and have already seen an outstanding improvement! I am an 18 year old mother that struggled throughout high school, not because of intelligence, but lack of motivation to complete things such as homework or projects. I failed quite a few classes and ended up having to take a second senior year. Since my daughter was born and I now have a house to clean and all other kinds of """"mommy duties,"""" I really found myself struggling. It was to the point of a failing relationship and disappointment to my family and my significant other. I was unable to just focus on a task and complete it. But today, I did everything I needed to do and then some and I feel great. Very pleased so far.;",9,
971,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 19 year old college student and just got prescribed Vyvanse about 2 days ago. When I take it I mainly feel relaxed and sometimes excited. I've never been on any stimulant or ADD medication before. My main concern is losing weight on this medicine. I'm about 5'9"""" and weigh about 135lbs. I eat a lot and I'm still fairly skinny. I've always worried about my weight and the last thing I want is to get skinnier.;",9,
972,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was diagnosed with ADD/ADHD when I was 21. I had failed out of university, I was unorganized, felt like a failure, and was frankly quite depressed. Vyvanse helped me focus and think more typically, and I was better able to do my school work. I'm about to graduate with a GPA of 3.8 and my heart is set on a masters degree! My only issue with this medicine is the moodiness I experience when coming off from it every single evening. I try to be doing something alone at this time, since it only lasts an hour or so, but I become very introverted and irritable. I also found that I'm crazy tired in the morning and sleep in. I used to be up at six thirty every morning! But the benefits far outweighs the cost.;",9,

Got sports scholarships throught T&F, BBAll got a driver liscense.Things were missing got 16 on ACT, still little to hyper and struck out with college girls, passed 1st semester with 3C, 1A, couldn't remember street name.

Before Vyvanse, I thought these medications were a joke, but I now admit that I was wrong.;",9,
975,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I wasn't a hyperactive kid. I have a high IQ (not bragging- just got genetically lucky there), so no one ever thought I had ADD, including me. However, looking back I never could get homework done on time. My backpack, school binder & bedroom were always a mess. As an adult I learned many organizational skills, but continued to struggle terribly with lack of motivation, focus & enjoyment in life, despite living in abundant material comfort. When I started taking 30mg of this a day at my doctor's urging, it was as if a bright light flooded what had previously only been utter darkness in my brain for 30 years. There's no """"buzz"""" to this medicine. It's simply a means to reaching a more positive mindset that I thought I was barred from forever.;",9,
976,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Was on Concerta 18mg for 3 years worked great. Stopped taking it, felt like I didn't need it anymore and I didn't want to pay for it then. Wasn't doing so well professionally or at home not getting chores done feeling real lazy etc. so I went back on the Concerta couldn't feel it this time bumped up to 36mg still most days didn't feel a difference tried Vyvanse definitely can feel motivation only doesn't seem to last as long as Concerta used to for me but I feel happy on Vyvanse, just wished it lasted longer also as a lot of people say less anxiety. I can say I don't have an anxiety problem on Concerta or on Vyvanse but Vyvanse feels like it has anti-anxiety medicine built into. I feel real comfortable where ever I go.;",9,

I've been on numerous different medications for it - Adderall XR, Concerta, Strattera, etc. Out of them all, Vyvanse has had the best results. Vyvanse helps me focus, get things done, act my age, and think before I act. I can focus on one thing at a time, rather than twenty things at once. One thing I have noticed about Vyvanse is that it treats my ADHD but doesn't take away from my personality. In other words, it doesn't make me feel like a zombie. I would definitely recommend Vyvanse to anyone with legitimate ADHD!;",9,
979,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"It helps a lot with paying attention, On 30mg once a day and it works up until about 7th-8th hour (5 hours after taking it) and for me suppresses my appetite so I don't care if I eat or not. Stomach still rumbles though. No other ill effects. I would recommend it. No jitteriness as with other stimulants such as Ritalin/Focalin. I feel much more like myself then on other medicines.;",9,

Responding well to Vyvanse 30mg. Easier transitions, speaks more fluently without stammering, less agitated, less angry, much more cooperative and calm, able to converse without interrupting or changing topics, happier, feels better about self.

I am more focused at home and especially at work. I am Mr. Mom and won't stop cleaning at home. I even cut and edge my neighbor's front yard. I lost 10 lbs and now weigh 197.

I hadn't realized how much noise went on in my head until it was quiet. Then I could have linear thought patterns. For the first time ever my life started to come together. I could see tasks in processes, I could think clearly, I could manage my emotions. It was amazing. Then the side effects kicked in. My dr and I went through every other adhd medication there was and nothing helped. I did more research and found that my problem was that all of the medications use dyes which gave me flu like symptoms. Vyvanse uses the most dyes so made me the sickest. I now take it out of capsule.;",9,

I have taken several different ADHD medicines through a period of several years, and Vyvanse is by far the most effective.

Of course these are just my experiences, but I would recommend Vyvanse to others.;",9,
989,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I had found myself spacing out and getting very easily distracted in school. I would always talk and anything from a noise to something moving out the window would distract me and get me off task somehow. I also had trouble staying focused on assignments that took a descent amount of time to finish. I finally told my psychiatrist about it and he gave me Vyvanse 30mg. It helped me out A LOT. I stayed focused, and if I started an assignment I finished it but he gave me a script for 1 a day every morning but I found myself taking 2 a day sometimes so he gave me the 60mg Vyvanse.

I can't wait for school to start again to see how well his social relationships will improve now that he's undergoing treatment.

It helps you focus a lot more than usual and it gives you the motivation to get work done. But the downside about it is that you feel depressed for a minute or anxiety, but after a couple of minutes you feel back motivated and happy. Also, I love that it gives you the mind clarity that I personally think everyone needs. Overall, my experience with Vyvance Is awesome. Btw I'm 15;",9,

I also take 100 mg of Neurontin 3x daily, which keeps any anxiety issues I may have (an issue that can be magnified by the Vyvanse) at bay. I couldn't be happier with the Vyvanse--started at 30 mg and am now at 50. Realizing that I had ADD changed my life--suddenly, my difficulties all made sense! The pill isn't magic--but taking it daily has given me the ability to use the tools I knew I should use and couldn't before (things like a calendar, or my checkbook register, or a budget, or a watch...).;",9,
997,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I used to sleep for like 12 to 24 hours straight very often for 2 years. I would sometimes fall asleep at work at dinner time. That caused me to be inattentive, distracted and sometimes more rarely sugar high hyperactivity sort of speaking. Now ever since then my problem is solved I can get up early and perform my task like normally so it works very well for both narcolepsy and ADD/ADHD. It could even work for depressed subjects.

It wasn't until mid 8th grade that I was prescribed Vyvanse. A miracle as far as my school performance, grades went from C's & D's to straight A's. Not only did I actually WANT to take it, Vyvanse compelled me to ace my schoolwork, resulting in consistent grades of 95 (the only downside being that it induced OCD behavior.) However, while I started at 40mg, I steadily increased to 70mg (max dose) by the end of 10th grade. I have since graduated high school, but due to the tolerance I built up to the medicine it no longer affects me nearly as well as it did before. Though I still recommend it to anyone with ADHD.;",9,

When I was a 20, I was taking 60 mg of Ritalin a day, and was failing all my classes. My doctor switched me to 70 mg of Vyvanse (started out at 70mg since I had been on a high dose of Ritalin for so long), and it was like magic! I started getting all A's and became more productive at work. The only bad things about the medicine are some of the side effects. I've noticed that gum helps with the dry mouth compared to just drinking water. Suffer from anxiety and insomnia now but take Celexa for anxiety and Ambien for insomnia. But all is good.;",9,

It has definitely helped with my attention disorder. It initially made me lose 10lbs and then leveled out. I have always been athletic except when my chronic pain is too bad. My son has ADHD and took Concerts for about 2 yrs. It helped tremendously with his anger and outburst and his grades. I only wish that my parents had me tested when I was younger as we did for my son. It would have taken away a lot of heartache! My daughter never suffered thankfully.;",9,

Also when I tried to REMEMBER stuff I would get distracted because that got too boring and moved on. But on Vyvanse I can concentrate with ease. I can REMEMBER stuff without even trying to. Nothing seems boring anymore in school but I hate it how it makes me sweat a lot like under the pits .. ALOT. For me there's a major loss of appetite like I don't eat anything once I'm on it beecause food doesn't sound, look or taste good. But I do get these random cravings.;",9,
1004,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 23 year old female, recently diagnosed with ADD. Thanks to my amazing doctor, he discovered my problem was actually not anxiety (like I've been told my entire life), but actually ADD. Makes complete sense. Always been a horrible student, and have had to work my butt off in college. Vyvanse is amazing: gives me energy, do not have to nap every day, my thoughts and emotions are very thought out, have already improved in school. I actually hear people when they talk to me now! I am much more social, relaxed, and confident. I feel like myself with Vyvanse. Only downfall- makes me really tired when it wears off in the evening and I cannot drink more than 1 or 2 cups of coffee during the day, or else I get very anxious!;",9,
1005,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 18 year old college freshman and started taking Vyvanse 10 months ago when I had finally gotten medicated for my severe ADD. It has significantly changed my life for the better. For as long as I can remember, my teachers always told my parents that I was very bright but I just would not """"apply"""" myself but after taking Vyvanse my grades have skyrocketed. I can finally pay attention in class and actually absorb the information. I feel energized, motivated, and more organized to do things. My days will be filled with productivity and I feel like it boosts my mood in general. My side effects include a slight anxiety because I feel like I should ALWAYS be doing something productive so sometimes its hard for me to relax.;",9,
1006,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been taking 30mg of Vyvanse for one week now. It works great. The first day I could really feel the amphetamine and found it too strong and unpleasant but on day 2 I did not feel bad from it. It lasts long, probably 12-14 hours and is very smooth. The crash is relatively mild. Previously I have been on dexamphetamine IR 3x10mg/day for one month which worked really well, but I wanted something that is sustained released. Before that I was on Ritalin IR and LA for over 15 years. The Methylphenidate just did not work as well as it used to and I found the side effects more and more unpleasant. I can really recommend Vyvanse so far. I am really calm from it and can focus very well on tasks. It also has less cardiac side effects than others.;",9,
1007,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I'm currently in college and from only a year being on this medicine I have seen a noticeable difference in my ability to focus. My grades have gone from almost all C's to almost all A's. Highly recommended!;,9,
1008,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My son has had ADHD for as long as I can remember. We have been through 5 different ADHD medicines with some sort of side affect with each one. I started doing research and finding out what my options were. I found the Vyvanse by accident and I had to find out more. What I read was so amazing I wanted it for my son. I couldn't believe how hard it was to get the Doctors to understand I knew what I was doing and I was going to do whatever it took to get my son the proper help. Well needless to say my son has been on this medicine for quite a few months now and the difference is Amazing. He went from D and F's (not kidding) to an A student in this past report card. To see the smile on his face and the sense of accomplishment was worth it all. ;,9,
1009,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"When I started receiving calls from my kindergarteners teacher at least once a week, I couldn't believe it. But after several months of struggling through the seemingly easiest of tasks I decided to take my daughter to counseling. Her counselor and psychiatrist took all of the right steps to diagnose her ADHD, and after 6 weeks of holding on to the prescription, I gave in and started administering the 20mg of Vyvanse. My daughter made a complete turn-around! Happy in the morning, soaring at school, and even sleeping well at night! In a month after starting Vyvanse, she was awarded """"student of the month"""", by the end of school she was """"most improved student of the year"""". My only concern is that she already needs the 30mg dose.;",9,
1010,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My life has changed. I lived in the prison of my own mind which shackled me and withered my optimism like a flower deprived of water. But now I'm free. For the first time I know what it is like to want to do things and feel accomplished when they are done!;,9,
1011,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 6. I am now 26 years old and just 3 years ago I wanted to be retested just to make sure if I even still have ADHD as bad as I did when I was a kid and of course it hasn't toned down. I have taken Ritalon and it made me very angry at night and a zombie by day. I have also taken Adderral, which I like and maybe might switch back. Vyvanse really helps me focus gives me a positive attitude and more energy but I get the worst migraines at night every night. Ritalin gave me headaches as well and I can barely sleep. I thought maybe I needed a new mattress so I bought a great one and still waking up a thousand times a night. It has its pros and cons like everything else.;",9,
1012,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 30 year old woman, recently diagnosed with ADD. I always knew there was an issue there because I have always been extremely irritable/short-fused, indecisive, impatient, impulsive, forgetful, anxious, etc. I somehow busted my butt through school and even managed to get my Bachelors degree but this came with re-reading lines of texts, taking several breaks while studying, and telling myself to focus constantly. I usually stare at someone talking but don't know what was said because I was thinking of something else completely. I couldn't remember movies or conversations to save my life. Docs said it was anxiety and increased the dose constantly. At 30mg and 4 days on Vyvanse, I feel great. Only headaches here and there but I'm hopeful!;",9,
1013,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This medication was basically my """"savior."""" I was diagnosed in the Fall semester of my junior year of college and I was put on Adderall XR. I was a mess on the Adderall. I started 50 mg of Vyvanse and I take it everyday for work and school. It's amazing. The only real side effect I have is that I am more talkative. I love that you do not feel the peaks (with time release) with Vyvanse.;",9,
1014,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvance is the 4th medicine we've tried for our 7 year old son's ADHD. He has been on Vyvance for close to a month now. With Vyvance, he still has a personality, it has a more natural, gradual start and end so he seems more balanced overall. With other medications, he would suddenly switch back to wild and impulsive as if you flipped a switch. The negative is that his appetite is definitely low. He has no interest in food during the day but gets hungry late at night. He is not falling asleep well at all, still awake after 2 hours of lying in bed. This is definitely due to the medication. He would always fall asleep within about 15 minutes. We've yet to find the right one, but this is definitely the best so far.;",9,
1015,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 9 yr old son starting taking this medicine 1 month ago. He was on Medadate CD for 3 yrs before this. It has been wonderful so far. His grades, homework time, handwriting, behavior and overall outlook on things have changed for the better. The side effects are no appetite and trouble settling down at night but they are getting better. My only advise is to feed them a very good breakfast before giving the medicine and have good meal waiting when they come off.;",9,
1016,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 50 y/o f just recently diagnosed with ADHD. My 32 y/o was diagnosed just 2 or 3 yrs ago. I have always been forgetful, impatient, unable to focus, misplaced items, etc. I went back to college 2 1/2 yrs ago and did excellent, but it was very hard even though I studied and knew the material it was the same in HS. I realized something was changing in my ability to learn and saw a doc on adults w/ADD & ADHD, realized it was hereditary, got tested and BAM. I've been on the initial 30 mg a day for a month. I feel sure doc will increase the dosage due to how long it lasts. But, It's GREAT, completely changed my life. I have a small decrease in appetite, must take it early to negate insomnia otherwise, awesome med.;",9,
1017,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I am a 20 year old male. I have taken Vyvanse to help me focus better on my tasks and also to improve my concentration. Vyvanse is a wonderful medication with very little negative side effects. ;,9,
1018,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son was DX with ADHD in Kindergarten. We have tried several different medicines. Vyvanse has been the best one yet. He is calmer and more focused in class. As with the other drugs he does experience side effects: no appetite, a little on the moody side. Overall this has been the best medicine we have tried to date.;",9,
1019,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I'm 48 years old and have three children. Two of which have ADHD. My son is 15 and started on 40mg of Vyvanse in January. The results have been amazing. He used to struggle to get D's and he was always getting in trouble at school for doing dumb impulsive things. His grades started coming up immediately and we never hear from the school about discipline problems. He's making A's and B's after 4 months. He's no longer forgetful and scatterbrained like before. He is as impressed as anyone with the results and wouldn't think of going a day without it.;,9,
1020,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Im a 19 year old male. I struggled through school my whole life but still tested past most my classmates. I was diagnosed with ADHD last year and was on a different medication that really didn't work and then a month ago my doctor prescribed Vyvanse and it has changed my life so much. I recommend that every person with ADHD try it out. Its amazing. The only real side effect I have is I'm a little more irritable.;,9,
1021,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Switched from Adderall to Vyvanse because I was experiencing negative side effects. Even on the smallest dose of Adderall I was anxious, had trouble with public speaking, and would have pretty bad mood swings. On Vyvanse I finally feel like a 'normal' person. My mom noticed a difference on the first day, and I no longer feel hopeless and discouraged while doing school work.;",9,
1022,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm writing a review to hopefully help others who haven't taken Vyvanse yet and want some information on what to expect. I felt REALLY uneasy and nervous prior to taking my first Vyvanse dose and it was honestly not worth the worry. I started at 40mg to help with my ADHD. I read lots of reviews how it makes you feel high and super active. I felt a little bit of a buzz but not high. It was just a pleasant feeling of happiness. I'm sure it's different for everyone, but mine wasn't extreme. I also felt like I had more energy, but not enough to obsessively clean my house like others that left reviews. Definitely take it early. It will keep you up otherwise. Only complaint so far!;",9,
1023,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was diagnosed three years ago with adult ADD (and I'm 46!). First was prescribed Adderall, but I found that even the slow-release capsule wore off quickly, leaving me exhausted and crashing at work, scarfing down cups of coffee. My doctor switched me by Vyvanse, and it's been much, much better. I am better able to focus, it lasts longer. However, it still doesn't get me through the whole day and I find I'm extremely tired at night. Also, sometimes I get caught up in the trivial details of both work and home projects. But on the whole, I am FAR better off since I began Vyvanse. I wish that 70mg was not the highest recommended amount, but I stick to it.;",9,
1024,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 22 year old female who was diagnosed with ADHD Inattentive subtype following my freshman yr of college. I've been taking Vyvanse for 3 yrs now (initially 30 mg, now 50 mg) and finally feel like I'm living up to my potential. For the first time ever, I am able to stay organized, complete tasks and actually show up on time! My only complaints are lack of appetite throughout day (ravenous at night) and the desire for a cigarette for the first 2 hrs after it """"kicks in"""" (never crave one when I'm not taking Vyvanse). ;",9,
1025,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse has changed my life in the best way! It's almost like a motivation pill. I can spend 12 hours in the library at a time studying, with little distractions. I made a 4.0 my first semester of college. I used to always want to work hard and study but could never quite pull it together, and with Vyvanse I can! The only downside is the dehydration. Remember to drink lots of water or you will get headaches!;",9,
1026,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have tried every AD(H)D pill known so far. I started in grade 4 and went off them in grade 7. I am weird as far as medicine goes and it never worked as intended, side effects for other pills were things such as no free will, not remembering anything that I did for 3 years, no control of self awareness or recollection of my actions, fainting or passing out without warning. I went off the pills in grade 7 due to mental and physical health issues and concerns. Decided to take the pills again because I need them to graduate, started on Vyvasne. It is 1000X times better than any other pill that I have tried over the years. Biggest problems is lack of appetite (went 26 hours without eating without realizing it) started on 80MG by mistake.;",9,
1027,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am so happy with vyvanse. It has made my life so good, I listen better, I can focus on tasks. I feel even more upbeat about life no serious worrying and has slowed me down to see life better, I am so blessed for this new medicine.;",9,
1028,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am an 18 years old and I have been taking this medication since I was 14. It helps me alot with concentration in fact without it I don't know how I would have graduated high school. While taking Vvyanse I have experienced all of its side effects which includes low and high blood presure, nervousness, uncontrolable body movemnets, numbness of my left side of the body etc., mostly because some days I would take it and then didn't take it for like a week so your body would have to get used to it all over again. I just recently had a baby and now am back on it again since I plan on going to College. ;",9,
1029,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I think it might be just as good as Adderall. I can't tell fully yet as I haven't totally adjusted to it. I do feel clear headed, focused and content.;",9,
1030,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse is great. It has a longer dosing window than Adderall XR (12 vs 8 hours for me) and a slightly improved side-effect profile. As a longtime (~16 years) prescription stimulant user, for ADHD, I would recommend Vyvanse to any user that is currently unsatisfied with their ADHD management. It is no silver bullet, but there are no silver bullets for ADHD. It is incremental innovation in a great way. Vyvanse is the first real stimulant to reduce side effects without cutting efficacy.;",9,
1031,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"42 year old male recently diagnosed with ADD (no hyperactivity). Vyvanse is the only medication I've tried and I'm reasonably happy with it. Started 30 mg for 2 weeks. Felt a little jittery and had a funny taste in my mouth. Increased to 70 mg. No longer feel jittery, no funny taste, but my mouth is always dry so I drink a lot of water. Vyvanse seems to help me get more done. I can't say I'm more focused, but I am more motivated, so the end result is more productivity, though not always directed in the best place. It decreased my appetite, so it was easier to switch to a healthier diet. Lost more than 25 lbs. in first 3 months, which has also helped increase self esteem, motivation and energy level.;",9,
1032,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 33 and have struggled with ADHD for as long as I can remember. I was prescribed Vyvanse for the first time 6 months ago. I noticed a huge difference within just a couple days. Unlike Ritalin and Adderall, I'm not moody and it actually works the entire day. My focus and concentration has improved greatly and so has my quality of life. The only drawbacks are that I've noticed a decreased appetite and usually it takes an hour or two to """"kick in"""". I don't take it on weekends to help avoid developing a tolerance (this was per my physician's advice) and I seem to be restless at night on days when I don't take it. But overall, Vyvanse has helped me more than any other ADHD medication I've ever been on. Strongly recommended!;",9,
1033,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"In England my mother took me to the doctor and being a nurse herself knew I had ADHD. The doctors wanted to put me on Ritalin but my mother said no, I would grow out of it eventually. In the US my attention from high school through college became worse, and I got into a lot of trouble. My grades were horrible in high school through college, even work. I had to take classes two to three times over again. The only way I would remember daily things was to write it down. Now at 41, I got help, and I am able to focus, complete tasks, remember without asking ten times, and sit still. It's never too late for help. Just wish I would of done this 35 years ago. My anger has subsided also with no side effects.;",9,
1034,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 3 1/2 year old son has taken Ritalin,Strattera,and Focalin. By far Vyvnase has been the best. My only complaint is about an hour after taking it and thru to the 3rd hour he is a bit """"slow,"""" however, over all he is like having a completely different child, positively speaking of course.;",9,
1035,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been using 70 mg Vyvanse and it was working perfectly for a month, in fact, it still works. The problem is that my blood pressure, which was perfect, went up 30 points in a month and now I'm at risk for high blood pressure. Also, I lost weight which I must gain back now. I'm only 16 and this is bad. I'm lean and athletic and have never had any health issues until this. Besides all of this, I really like Vyvanse and hopefully won't have to stop taking it.;",9,
1036,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My son started taking this medicine about 9 months ago. His grades went from C's and D's to A's and B's. He is able to focus and concetrate. He isn't a zombie walking around the house. He still has some emotion and can still have fun. I love this medicine because even he can see the diffence it has made in his life.;,9,
1037,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Amazing medication! My teenager has severe ADHD, and it has turned her life around! She is able to be her true self, but before her severe ADHD often overshadowed her great personality. She does have depression and anxiety but the Vyvanse does not cause that. The medicine did make her lose almost 25 pounds, and she was in 9th grade and she weighed 99 pounds. She was really small, and we almost had to take her off the medicine, but she eventually started gaining weight. She is still very small, but her weight is healthy. It does make her a bit more irritable, but it's nothing compared to the rage she had before the medicine. Vyvanse has finally been able to get rid of that ADHD, and help her think clearly, and be herself!;",9,
1038,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 21 year old male diagnosed with ADD around 4 years ago. About a while back I was prescribed to 50mg of Vyvanse. So far its effects have been very positive. In the past, I have been on Strattera and Adderall. The eupohric feeling Adderall produces brings a high potential for abuse and dependence, along with extreme mood changes and irratability. With Vyvanse, the urge for more does not exist. It is consistent throughout most of the day and delivers concentration and a sense of confidence and well-being. I've had slightly decreased appetite, but am much more productive and focused. I feel that I have gotten my life back. It is the best ADD medicine I have been on. Highly recommended.;",9,
1039,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 16 years old, and I've just recently started taking Vyvanse. I just started taking a new pill for my depression. Zoloft, which started helping. But I could notice a HUGE difference with Vyvanse right away. I am much more talkative, been in a better mood, less lazy, and I actually don't mind cleaning my room every now and then. I used to fight with my boyfriend all the time about things, which I now realize should have been no big deal at all. But now, things have changed. I'm excited for school, even because I want to see if Vyvanse will help me bring up my grades and concentrate better, instead of falling asleep in class. Some side effects I've noticed though is not having an appetite, and talking too much.;",9,
1040,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My Grandson was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago when he was 7. We started him in councelling and they recommended we try medication. I resisted not knowing much about ADHD. They tried him on a couple of different medicines (without success) before we tried Vyvanse the first dose 30mg did show a vast improvement but it didn't last long. We increased the doses several times before reaching his current dose of 60mg. Like the others have stated he has loss of appetite and trouble going to sleep. They continually monitor his weight and take blood samples to make sure there is no harm to liver and kidneys. He still has occasional meltdowns which we have learned to recognize. In school he has gone from impulsive to compulsive but again it runs in spurts.;,9,
1041,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 44 year old woman who just got diagnosed with ADD. Vyvanse is the first medication prescribed to me and I have been on 50mg for about a month. The first 2 days I was hyped up, euphoric, and extremely talkative. After that and now it has actually mellowed me out, I am in a good mood all day for the first time in 30 years (severe chronic depression). I can't believe the difference and wish I would have had something like this years ago. I might've had a better life. I can concentrate and happily socialize now. I have had zero side effects! Amazing.;",9,
1042,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 16 and I started using Vyvanse a little over one month ago. I am a very bright student but I found myself struggling through school. I was diagnosed with ADD around 4th grade. I have always had trouble focusing and staying on task. I tried Concerta, Ritalin, Strattera and Adderal. After taking those I took about a 4 year break from medicine. I began Welbutrin and am now taking that in combination with Vyvanse. My grades improved tremendously. I can now focus and it shows. I went from a D in Algebra/Geo to an A. My life and confidence has improved more than I ever thought possible. I do have decreased appetite but other than that, this medicine is literally making my future brighter everyday.;",9,
1043,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Oh, if there was an 11, I would give Vyvanse this rating, if it was not for one side effect. But I am not 100% sure it is the Vyvanse. I have been having pretty bad chest pains since I started on Vyvanse a couple of months ago. I even went to the ER for an asthma attack. The trouble is, for the last few years (pre-ADHD diagnosis and any meds) I have been slowly growing into adult onset asthma. So it's tough even for the doctors to tell if it's from the asthma or the Vyvanse! The ER doc said no, Vyvanse shouldn't cause chest pains, so did my psychiatrist (who I trust and really respect). Long story short--I LOVE VYVANSE!! Has given me my life whole new meaning. I am the best version of myself. My whole entire extended family notices!;",9,
1044,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 22 year old male with a horrible case of ADHD. In the past I've taken Adderall which made me absolutely nuts. Since starting Vyvanse I have noticed the euphoric high feeling is gone and the focused, mellow feeling kicking in. I take 70mg daily and it lasts me a solid 10 hours. Wish I had been on this medicine from the start!;",9,
1045,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have realized after my child started taking Vyvanse, her grades improved dramatically! She is able to concentrate and pay attention to what is going on instead of being confused. This medication has been working great for her and we have not had to up the dosage. It was very scary at first, however, it turned out to be a great decision.;",9,
1046,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was prescribed Vyvanse to combat daily fatigue caused by autonomic dysfunction. It treats those symptoms very well, but prolonged use has a large impact on my mood and personality. By the 2nd week, I was feeling very sad all day every day. A strange side effect that I encountered was that it made my armpits quite literally drip with sweat. The only other bothersome side effect is that it initially kept me up until 5/6 am, but that was remedied with 0.1mg Clonidine before I went to bed. I'm sure this medicine works very well for those with ADD and ADHD, as that is what it is designed for. If you are looking for a solution to chronic fatigue caused by autonomic dysfunction, you may want to consider other options.;",9,
1047,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"As a 44 year old male, who recently went for treatment of this problem. I went for almost 43 with always knowing that something was missing. Being a over achiever I made every attempt to complete everything but never really completed anything. This drug has changed that. It allows me to focus on the task that I have in front of me and complete it. Which has been a breath of fresh air for my job, my marriage and my kids.;",9,
1048,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 19 years old 4'11, small-framed, and I weigh 85 pounds. I didn't notice a great change in weight when I stopped it for one whole summer when I was 11. I just gained 4 more pounds. Nonetheless, I'm not underweight, bulimic, or anorexic. I've always been thin and petite. I'm on 60mg of Vyvanse for ADHD currently, but I've been prescribed it for awhile. What can I say about this medicine? It's great! Yes, it suppresses the appetite a little, and sometimes I have to force myself to eat. This medication doesn't alter my personality oddly like Adderall. I'm still me, just more focused. My only complaint is that it mostly wears off in the evening when I need focus. I'm a singer too, so dry mouth is a side-effect that I could do without.;",9,
1049,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 42, highly successfully in my career and family life but always thought I had ADD or ADHD . I got decent grades in high school and college but always felt like it was a struggle and I would have to beat myself up for hours with guilt and fear of failure to produce even passing results. After 20 years, I've decided to actually do something about it. I tried both Adderall and Vyvanse and Vyvanse is superior because it's less harsh. I've benefited from it but it does make me anxious.. I take Ativan to help with that.. I'm also on Brintellix. I hate being on tons of meds but if I can increase my quality of life and be a better person it's worth it. ;",9,
1050,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"After trying Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall. This medicine changed everything. I am organized and focused for first time in my life, I'm 38.

1051,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Then put me on 20mg, and now I am on 40 mg. Throughout this whole trial, I have noticed a huge difference. I do have less appetite like everyone else does. But that don't bother me. I am over weight already. I also concentrate way better. I am much happier during the day and my patience has increased. He did put me on Lexapro for my anxiety and that is all going good as well.;",9,

1053,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My general physician first prescribed me Concerta (Intermediate dosage) and it seemed to make me feel depressed, anxious, and more obsessive (thought-wise anyway). I was then prescribed Adderall XR (10 mg) and found that I would feel more productive and relaxed earlier in the day upon taking it, but then the side effects really began to hit hard. I was hesitant to continue to try another stimulant because I was actually diagnosed with anxiety (by my psychiatrist) and mild depression and the stimulants seemed to heighten these symptoms. He then suggested that I try Vyvanse and he also put me on Atterax (for anxiety/allergies ---weird combination, I know) in addition to Prozac. Vyvanse has been a life-saver, mild side effects, and no """"crash"""".;",9,
1054,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,This worked amazing with my son. Our biggest problem was he didn't want to eat and lost a lot of weight.;,9,
1055,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My Son has been taking Vyvanse for about a year now 70mg but he was on other medications before this and although they helped, we had moved and the new doctor did not want to prescribe him anything but Vyvanse and after some research I actually found that Vyvanse is one of the best for ADHD. The only side effects he has had was loss of appetite and insomnia but he is taking something to help him sleep and he eats good in the morning before he takes his medicine just doesn't like eating lunch so I bribe him if he wants to go play games he must eat a snack just like an apple or something no more weight lose just a steady weight now. School has become so much easier for him with grades and the teachers see a great change in him. ;",9,
1056,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been taking this medicine for over two years now and when I first started taking it it turned my life around. I'm a senior in high school now and a high honors student and I credit my success mostly to the medication. After taking the 70mg dose for a long amount of time I have noticed that the benefits of the pill have decreased. Now, the medicine wears off within five hours of taking it. Compared to before when it would last all day. I do not feel as focused as I used to while taking it, I do not feel the loss of appetite anymore, and I am becoming more forgetful.;",9,
1057,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son was diagnosed with ADHD when he was in the first grade. At the advice of his then doctor we did not treat him with any medications. My son is the sweetest, kindest kid and wanted to please everyone (teachers, parents, etc). However, he struggled so much with academics and general life organization. Homework time was a nightmare. By the time he was in 4th grade I broke down and took him to a doctor to try medications because something HAD to change. Vyvance has changed his life for the better. All of his grades went up in a matter of weeks, his homework is completed correctly and neatly before I even get home, and he will even tell you he feels better in general. He also tried Adderrall but that just made him very hostile.;",9,
1058,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Im 17 and have always had a hard time with my depression and Bi-polar disorder. I take medication for them and it's helped but there was still my motivation lacking. I was prescribed Vyvanse and the first day I took it I knew it was the miracle I had been waiting for. It helps my motivation tremendously whether its school work or not, I get more done. And am actually enthusiastic about doing it. The only semi bad thing about it I would say is anxiety. My arms especially get very anxious.;",9,
1059,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Honestly it worked really well for me and even helped take away some of my anxiety (stopped racing thoughts) but I started off at a way too high dose and had trouble with insomnia and some dry mouth but I felt the effects after about an hour and it really does last all day.;,9,
1060,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I can honestly say that Vyvanse changed my life. Was diagnosed with ADD at age of 35; my quality of life has improved dramatically with Vyvanse. I sometimes feel as if I should be a spokesperson for this as I rave about how much it has helped me. ;,9,
1061,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Today was my first day taking Vyvanse and wow! I usually have a sad down feeling and don't want to talk to anyone. I am a 26 year old college student. But today I actually made two new friends from class and went to lunch with them. I feel like I can walk in a room with confidence now. The only bad thing is I did have a mild headache around 9 pm. After it wore off and it only lasted around 8 hours with a dry mouth I am on the 60 mg dose. The other great thing is I actually felt like being in class today and took 7 pages of notes and sat in the very front of the class and wasn't afraid to ask questions! I'm happy to have found Vyvanse and paying attention is so much easier now. Highly recommended for people with ADD.;,9,
1062,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My 9 year old son started taking Vyvanse when all the other ADHD meds failed. Although he still had his fits sometimes they are few and far between. His grades in school are improving and he is able to pay attention better.;,9,
1063,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 23 year old female. My entire life I have tested highly, been in advanced classes, had a full scholarship through college, but my grades were always a struggle. I felt like I had to work so much harder than everyone else just to keep my B grades. I was disorganized, forgetful, irritable, and pretty desolate. I felt like I was drowning. I have taken medication for depression and anxiety since I was in high school - everything from Wellbutrin, to Xanax, to Prozac. I graduated from college in four years with a mediocre GPA, but with many awards. Finally my new doctor actually listened when I spoke, and she agreed that we try a course of medication for ADHD. I am on my second week of Vyvanse and am a new, happy, functioning person.;",9,
1064,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,It is a good medicine. Helps in school. Although I am concerned because my son is very pettie and he doesn't have regular appetites. I read the side effects and it said that this medication can slow down growth. My son has a big issue about his height. Beside all of that he start taking Vyvanse after I took him off Adderall XR and it's a BIG difference in his attitude.;,9,
1065,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"First started off on 30 mg for ADHD and OCD. I have noticed a complete 180 in just two and a half weeks and not just with concentration but my mood of frustration and confusion. In beginning it did make me tired but that has gone and I've actually had have dose increase to 60 mg. Overall, great medication for me.;",9,
1066,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Very smooth stimulant. Effective for a little over 8 hours in my experience, not the 12 or 13 hours the manufacturer claims. I take 40mg and have for over a month and have no need to up the dose. I gave it 9/10 instead of 10/10 because it takes 2 to 3 hours to start working. But there is no crash and is incredibly smooth compared to IR Adderall, Focalin or Ritalin. I also have an prescription for 10mg IR Adderall to take at 5pm so after work I can study or work out or just be productive because by 5pm the Vyvanse has totally worn off.;",9,
1067,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son is almost 7 years old and has ADHD. His Doctor put him on Strattera and Metadate CD 2 years ago. His behavior got worse and worse (Doctor even diagnosed him with ODD). I refused to believe that my child could control his behavior and I knew this was a result of his medicines. His Doctor kept saying no, he just needs more structure etc. I finally DEMANDED that we take him off both medicines and try something else. I insisted we try Vyvanse. The BEST thing I have ever done. My son is now a sweet, happy, normal little boy who rarely gives us problems. His appetite is back, he gets along great with other kids and we are amazed at the change in him. I highly recommend that other parents give this medication a try for their ADHD children.;",9,
1068,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 7 year old son was recently diagnosed as ADHD and I was really hesitant to put him on medicines but when I took him to the doctor she said yes no doubt he had ADHD so they put him on Vyvanse at 30 mg. The first day and I was ready to cry myself. It was like he had eaten a whole gallon of ice cream he could not stop talking and did not sleep the first 2 nights, but I am really happy with the outcome. He is so much better. I can hear my thoughts now so I am a believer in the medicines it worked for him.;",9,
1069,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Gave me back my life;,9,
1070,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm on Vyvanse for ADD and social phobia. I also take 1 milligram of clonazepam, which helps with the anxiety stimulants may cause. In my experience, you'll crash and feel extremely anxious, depressed, and moody when taking anything less than 60 milligrams.;",8,
1071,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 19 years old and started taking 50mg Vyvanse today, being diagnosed with ADD. So far today, i haven't any problems focusing and actually WANT to get my work done. It did take around 2 hours to start working, but there were no jitters. I never thought ADHD or ADD was a problem of mine, but it does run in my family.;",8,
1072,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I first took Vyvanse about a year ago, was up to 50mg a day. I found it extremely helpful, but by late afternoon I was angry at everything and everyone. I decided to stop. I then tried a few other medicines (Strattera and Concerta). Strattera didn't really work as well as a stimulant and had very negative effects on my sex life, and Concerta didn't really work at all. I was ready to give up, but decided to give Vyvanse another try. This time I lowered the does to 30mg, and only took it during the work week. WOW - it made a huge difference. I'm not seeing the same side effects that I did first time. So it is clear to me that I was over medicating. Anyways, just thought I would share.;",8,
1073,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"26y/o male 5'9 170lb taking vyvanse for 6-7 years. Started with 30mg now on 60mg. I had previously been given everything else for ADHD but nothing stuck long term. Vyvanse has helped, coupled with regular exercise and healthy eating habits. ;",8,
1074,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 16 and was recently diagnosed with ADD. I find Vyvanse extremely helpful for the first 6 hours, and then as I come off of it I often have a depressive mood swing for about an hour. I have been trying other medications but Vyvanse works the best for me (except for the mood swings). I am almost never hungry. I have lost about 22lbs in 2 months. It's important to keep a regular eating schedule. I continue to try different medications, but this one has extremely changed my life for the better in school and in social settings.;",8,
1075,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son, 12, is on 20 mg of Vyvanse. He is ADHD and has reacted poorly to most of the other stimulants we tried. The 30 mg caused him to have side effects of stomach pains and emotional irritability and rebound problems. By switching him to 20 mg he is able to maintain his junior high honors classes and be functionable and focused. By going down to the 20 mg he is able to have a personality and yet not be flicking and annoying people. Without the medicine he was unable to stay seated at the piano to practice and now he is proficient and can practice on his own without me telling him to sit down every 3 minutes. It has also been a tremendous self esteem boost.;",8,
1076,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am productive but I am not myself, I can't sleep. I stay up for days on end because there is so much I have to do. My body just wants rest, my pulse is pounding behind my eyes. I can't remember the last time my body or my mind allowed me to eat, hunger is a distant memory. I am gregarious in conversations and go off like Charlie Sheen. I have stayed up for days, until white walls turned orange. I have been on Vyvanse for a year and before that Medidate, Stratera, Concerta, Daytrana, Ritalin, Adderall. I don't know who I am outside of my daily dose because I've been fed since I was 9, I'm 21 now. I have a 4.0 GPA, I am miserable. None of these are good, the alternative is worse.;",8,
1077,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My son is 9 yrs old and has been on Vyvanse for about 2 yrs or so and I have to say that its been a miracle medicine. I believe I finally got my baby boy back he also takes Intuniv as a booster pill....but my only problem is that he has chronic insomnia and no over the counter or prescribed medicine seem to make him fall asleep and stay asleep.;,8,
1078,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"56 yrs old. Tried Ritilin 15 years ago but stopped halway thru my first prescription because there was an edginess for me. I've experienced too many jobs and excuses since then so i've just started on Vyvance. Its just four days but my mind is focussed, not hyper just comfortably clear. I'm very happy to be so productive. Eating well, sleeping well. I will add an update in a month.;",8,
1079,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"High schooler, last year failed with D's and F's now I have A's and B's across the board. I'm taking 30mg of Vyvanse every morning, and it has turned my schooling in a complete 100% success. Only negative thing I can say, I've been having very short tempers. Anything can make me go off, I had it before taking medication but now it's more common for me to get very faster. Other than that no complaints! For a school setting this medicine is amazing.;",8,
1080,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and since then my life have been a total wreck. I didn't get any work done in school or focused on anything also forgetting a lot of things frequently. I went to my psychiatrist and she prescribed me Vyvanse 30mg. The first day I took it I felt AWESOME I focused more and I was very talkative which is normal for me, anyways no change there. But since I'm 5'9 and 230lbs I need the weight loss so that's good for me. Right now I double dosed because I want this to last longer not until 12p.m.;",8,
1081,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son is 10 and I have known for a long time he had inattentive ADHD, but his school didn't want to help me get a diagnosis, and I was trying to tell myself he didn't have it. He changed schools this year, now a 5th grader, and I happened to ask his teacher how his attention and focus was. He was unfocused during the day. They did a time on task and it showed he was 40% more off task than his peers during different times in the day. His teacher and I filled out the normal forms which ask how unfocused rating 1-5 etc. and our answers were near identical. His doctor saw the info and sure enough, an ADHD diagnosis. He was put on 20mg Vyvanse just this week, and he seems so much more focused!;",8,
1082,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 17 year old female who was diagnosed with ADD about 9 months ago. I had mainly B and C grades, I was scatter-brained, easily distracted, and extremely messy. Since I started Vyvanse at 30mg, I have bumped up to 40mg and I have no complaints. I have all A and B grades, I can focus on my school work, and get things accomplished in a reasonable amount of time. Only critisicm I have is the fact that is caused me to go from messy to borderline OCD. However, I like cleaning and I see it as a plus side to the medication. As is usual for ADD and ADHD medicines, I experience easy mood swings and sudden out bursts of anger, loss of appetite, and lack of sleep. However, overall I am extremely pleased as a high schooler who was struggling.;",8,
1083,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Though told stories by family how ACTIVE I have always been, despite its' negative tone, I always thought """"ACTIVE"""" was positive. Now 44 with 2 children, a husband, my 5 year old was diagnosed with ADHD. With her diagnosis, came mine. I take 40mg of Vyvanse in the morning and it allows me to focus in the way I have always strived to. With it, I achieve my goals more comfortably, but I make sure I eat before taking it, drink a lot of water and try to exercise. It is not a magic pill and it is still essential to use the coping strategies I developed from years of having to cope on my own. My only concern is my heart and blood pressure. Overall, this is a solid, good medication that allows for a more balanced life.;",8,
1084,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I have been taking this medicine for my ADHD and in the first couple of days I have lost five pounds. I don't know if this is normal and I am trying to find that out. I also have stomach aches all day long with loss of appetite. I'll get lightheaded some times. But it does help me concentrate on what I am doing and say focused.;,8,
1085,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Been on Vyvanse for three months now. I'm 6 foot 195 pounds and 20 years old but find even the 30 mg dosage to be more than enough for me. Experience occasional bouts of dizziness and when in stressful situation have some degree of chest pains. Lasts more than the full 12 hours for me. I have to wake up at 8 am in order to fall asleep around 1 AM. Also when I take Vyvanse I notice some degree of hair loss. I feel as if my brain is telling my body to work and as a result my body is working in triple overtime to keep up.;,8,
1086,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have just started using Vyvanse a couple days ago. Even though I haven't been on it for very long, I already notice some differences in my everyday life. Almost everything has changed for the greater good. The only bad thing I have to pick on is that I have experienced a multitude of side effects such as headaches, rapid heart beats, and dizziness. Other than that, I like Vyvanse so far. My opinion in the future may or may not change, but most likely not. The effects of Vyvanse are pretty immediate, for me at least. It has also come to my attention that some people don't notice any change sometimes.;",8,
1087,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"The only bad thing is it acts like a diet pill, so I hardly eat. It seems to make me act like an efficient robot, so I always have to be doiing something productive, without showing emotion or change in facial expression.;",8,
1088,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been taking this medicine for two weeks now. Most of the side effects have gone away with the exception of the lack of appetite which is not really a bad thing. My life has improved I have been taking 50 mg. I cleaned my car for the first time in 6 months! The only problem is, it does not last for 12 hours, after about 6 hours I start to crash then at 8-9 hours I start to get anxious and OCD. I don't know if I have to increase my dose but am unsure because of heart issues it causes. Pros: Helps with organization, I am excited about things for the first time when I was a teenager. My symptoms went from more external ADD to internal ADD as I became an adult' Cons: Does not last full 12 hours, can make me moody.;",8,
1089,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Vyvanse had """"decent"""" effectiveness and minimal side effects . It was also (pretty much) the most effective medicine for me, despite it not being all that great at relieving many of my ADHD symptoms. (I have tried Dexedrine, Concerta, Adderall XR and, of course, Vyvanse).;",8,
1090,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was on Ritalin XR, but it felt like rat poisen too me. I was only remembering the ups and downs, and the short goodtime was not worth it. Yesterday I took my first Vyvanse (Elvanse (EU)) and I was in heaven for the first time in my life. Everything that has been my problems seemed to vanish to some extent, and it lasted the all day! I'm so happy right know. I'm sitting writing this 2 hours into my second dose (day), and the most fantastic feeling has already kicked in. I'm so amazed that I can't get it out loud enough. :) I have been late diagnosed ADHD at age 48. I have struggled all my life with lot of failing, and had to work twice as much as others too achieve my goals. I'm so thrilled now for what the future will bring for me!;",8,
1091,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 26 and started taking classes again. I was diagnosed ADD at 9 and was off and on Adderall and Ritialin through high school. I would always take it in the morning of school days, and not take it on weekends. I'm on 70 mg Vyvanse now I've been on for 3 months. I like it because it suppresses my appetite the least of the 3 medicines. I'm getting concerned though, because with school and work I will take 2 a day sometimes. But I still don't take it on non work or school days, but my concern is I think I am feeling withdrawal effects. I took it 12 days straight between 70 and 140mg a day, and the first day I didn't take it I couldn't get out of bed and felt depressed and had no motivation. I'm on day 2 and my brain feels like mush.;",8,
1092,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have a 7 year old son with ADHD. He was diagnosed at 4 years old. Through the years he has been on 3 different medications. Ritalin was first and it did help with his hyperactivity level, however he still had problems with impulsiveness. Then he was on Focalin XR and that did nothing with his impulsiveness and hyperactivity. Now he is on Vyvanse and that has helped with ADHD symptoms. The only problem that I am currently having is that he has days where he is extremely emotional. He has days where he is getting upset over minor details like coming home after playing at a friends house. I am not sure if this is drug related or ADHD related. Impulsive people have problems containing their emotions.;",8,
1093,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was having my son tested for ADD and the doctor ended up suggesting I get tested also. I am a 39 yr old male. I always new I was capable of more, I always felt fairly intelligent. I always had issues recalling details of projects and a roller coaster ride of motivation. I would wait until I have the pressure of the timeline closing before acting. I have become a dynamo at work and home. Instead of thinking about 100 different details of multiple projects all at once, I am able to focus on one at a time, but I have to stay organized because I can see details of something and I can't help but work on it because I get excited I can see everything so clearly. I get dry mouth and have trouble winding down at night. Can't stop working.;",8,
1094,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I can focus so much easier now, my thoughts are manageable and I can keep them straight in a way I never have before the only downsides are I am basically emotionless and it's difficult for me to let loose and have fun. Also another problem is when I miss a day I turn into a lunatic, like I am hyperactive, running on pure energy and unable to control what comes out of my mouth (thank God my teachers are cool!).;",8,
1095,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This medicine works extremely well. I have been very pleased with its effects and yielded results in many different areas in my life. From greatly increased concentration to unknown sources of motivation to succeed, Vyvanse has helped me immensely. I also think that I should put this in here too. I am eighteen and have experienced depression before. During one such battle, I thought that a """"nice way to end things,"""" would be to really overdose on my medicines. Well, turns out that you just get a really strange night's sleep and an awful stomach ache for a day with your fair share of vomiting. Needless to say, I learned my lesson and really just told myself how stupid I was and went on with life. However, all in all, this medicine is very good.;",8,
1096,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 24, in gradschool and I've been taking the 70mg for about four months. At first I lost ten pounds but now have maintained my appetite. When I don't take it I do feel an uncontrollable desire to eat a lot. I have difficulty sleeping at night and sometimes won't fall asleep until 3 or 4 am, and I take the medicine as soon as I wake up. I think it works best a few hours after taking it. Feel no anxiety and accomplish a lot- but then wears off by the afternoon. Also I was prescribed an anti-depressant before but I feel this somewhat takes care of that. I still prefer taking Vyvanse now but I do think I'll stop for a while after graduating because I'm not sure about the long term effects.;",8,
1097,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Wish my parents would have figured this out for me when I was in School. I found out Vyvanse really helps me with my attention problems (focusing mainly). I have been taking Vyvanse for 1 year now and I'm 43. My daughter who has had attention with focusing since 2nd grade struggled all the way through high school with no medicine to help. She started college 1 year ago (when we both started taking Vyvanse) and she now is enjoying college with excellent grades even winning awards for student of the quarter and being selected for some honor club! Oh by the way in high school she was making c,d and f's and dropped out her senior year but did get her GED. She says she never new she was smart but now realizes she just couldn't pay attention.;",8,

1099,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 15 year old female. I started taking Vyvanse around 5 months ago. When I first started taking it I saw a difference immediately. I was always on 50mg. It made me very irritable and emotional the first times I took it. Currently, I've been taking this for a few months and it is starting to become less effective on me. I am now starting to double up my doses taking 50mg to 100mg a day. It gets me through the day and keeps me awake. Not to mention excellent grades in school.;",8,
1100,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I've been on this medication twice in the past two years. First I was on focalin then vyvanse for about five months till I found out I was pregnant. It helps me a lot. I can focus a lot better but sometimes its hard to tell what I'll be focusing on. Sometimes its cleaning or sometimes its researching a very unimportant subject online.;,8,
1101,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a kid. I've tried all sorts of medications, (two type of Adderall and I don't even remember what else). Around two years ago, my doctor decided to switch me to Vyvanse. It is effective, I won't lie, but the side effects make it less than desirable. I am a 17 year old on a 7 year old's dosage and it still causes me to have mood swings, become irritable and antisocial, and kills my appetite. If I happen to be stressed out, on my period, and on Vyvanse on the same time (both tantrums and objects will be thrown). I've taken to using it on an as needed basis. It's not as effective this way, and my doctor doesn't like it, but at least I can balance academics and a social life this way.;",8,
1102,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 22-year-old female who was only diagnosed with ADHD when I was 20. Although it was a """"known"""" problem throughout my entire life, I had never been diagnosed since I was able to maintain A's and B's throughout my schooling. Upon arriving to college though, I went from being a rockstar student to crashing and burning my first semester. After struggling with the idea of taking a stimulant and avoiding medication, I finally caved and tried Vyvanse. I'm very glad I made the decision because it really helps me direct my thoughts and focus and therefore has reduced a great deal of anxiety that I was experiencing from the frustration of """"not getting my life together"""".;",8,
1103,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 29 and was just given Vyvanse for ADD. Always knew I had it, but was to embarrassed to actually do anything about it. After taking this medication for the last week, it was really a huge mistake to wait. It has fixed my memory, my focus, my social anxiety, can go places and don't want to leave right away. I am sure things can still turn but it has been the best week of my life that I can remember. If I can get past the side effects, dry mouth, stomach pain, little trouble sleeping (all worth it for me) I'll be good. Now I just hope it can fix my spelling soon.;",8,
1104,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Ok I've been on V for 3 years now cuz I've tried all the other amphetamine based """"Adderall, AdderallXR,etc. Vyvanse seemed to address my ADHD issues but its almost a year since I've lost my appetite and most days I'll have a KIND bar in the morning but I take my V. It can be 8am or 11am and still haven't been able to eat. It feels like u have the flu and nothing seems appetizing, I take a multivitamin, B12 complex, as well as Iron. I have lost weight but after a year with not eating consistently but I am tired all day, crabby, my teeth hurt too ;",8,
1105,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This is my second day on Vyvanse. I am very excited to try this drug in hopes that this one will work. I have been on Metadate and Strattera both didn't seem to help me at all. The first day I took this I did well at work. I am a server and usually mess up something but no mess-ups that day! Afterwards I cleaned my room, which I have been meaning to do forever, and I saw a movie. I did not talk once. My friends were amazed, as was I. I usually ruin movies by talking over them. I have a good feeling about Vyvanse but I will need more time to really tell if it's right for me. I did have a few outbursts though and afterwards felt silly. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of the drug.;",8,

He was on Dexedrine,which we felt was doing very well on his focus which gave him better grades,but it lacked in controlling impulsive behavior. We see a noticeable difference in this issue with Vyvance 30mg.once a day. The only thing that we do notice clearly is lack of appetite at supper time and you can actually tell when his medication has worn off. His undesirable behavior is back) also becomes fidgety.;",8,
1107,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been slowly taking increasing doses of Vyvanse for recently diagnosed ADD. I've been on this particular stimulant for probably 6 months.

This is life changing for me as for the first time I was actually fired from a job I had for 9 years right after finding out my work issues were largely do to ADD, even though I advised them of my condition and that I would be improving. I am in a new job with an employer who is much more caring and I'm doing better now that I have found a medication to help me. By far positives of this medication outweight the negatives.;",8,
1108,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Had trouble sleeping.;,8,
1109,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I've been on and off Adderall XR for a couple years and I've always hated that 'crash' when the medicine starts wearing off. Vyvanse doesn't have that crash and it lasts a lot longer than Adderall. It's the best medicine I've been on so far.;,8,
1110,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,It works wonders;,8,
1111,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a student who has used Vyvanse for the last few years. I am currently taking 40mg-50mg. When I first tried it, a couple side effects were annoying but it didnt last that long. When I was in High School, most of the day I felt like doing my work and getting stuff done, and it made me see the positive in things. And in college when I take it, especially on my days off, I get a lot of work done. I am not a very talkative person, but it made me feel like having nice conversations with people. In mid day, I am in a great mood, but sometimes it goes away every now and then. I dont feel like eating almost all day, but Its smart to eat breakfast before hand, and then dinner. I do have a small crash at the end of the day but it's worth it.;",8,
1112,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 21 years old, and have been on Vyvanse for 5 months (40mg). Compared to other medications its more evenly released throughout the day and seems to last around 8 or 9 hours. I would definitely suggest giving it a month before you completely ban it, because it did take getting use to (like any medication). It can effect your sleep depending on the time of day you take your medication. It hasn't decreased my appetite, but in the beginning I would forget to eat- as long as you get on a routine eating schedule though you should be fine. It made me slightly irritable in the beginning, but like I said give it some time and it seems to even out.;",8,
1113,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My 6 year old has been on Vyvanse for 3 years. There are times that I have not had any medicines to give him and the teacher says its like a whole other kid. Without him being on Vyvanse I was at the school all the time and my grades were dropping. I did not want him on medicines at first but I am so happy that I decided to. He is still my little Buge and not a hot mess. Such a joy and thanks to Vyvanse I have my son back. ;,8,
1114,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"After entering into a rigorous educational program where I am in the operating room for hours at a time, I realized I needed to see my doctor for my ADHD. I first tried Adderall XR. I had severe side effects, nearing a heart attack. I went back to the doctor and was prescribed Vyvanse. I also have a history of anxiety and some depression. Vyvanse has been amazing! I can focus and my anxiety is nearly gone. I will say that I had more focus with Adderall, but an unnecessary amount of focus. I feel normal on Vyvanse, like I am not on medication. My heart rate does increase during the first couple of hours. I also have to time the dose just right or I will either not sleep or the meds will wear off too soon.;",8,
1115,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was diagnosed with ADHD, this year, at age 20 as a Sophomore in college. Vyvanse is the first and only medication I have ever taken to treat my ADHD. Pre Vyvanse, I had a cumulative 3.5 gpa in my first two semesters of college. Post Vyvanse after 1 semester of taking it, I got a 3.62 GPA. While my GPA didn't increase tremendously, I did notice that I could pay attention in class a lot better and that I was learning a lot more. On Vyvanse, I can easily put 12 hours in the library if needed and be way more organized. I recently obtained an internship for Xmas break, and I wouldn't be able to work 60+ hours behind a desk per week without it. Vyvanse has made a difference in my life.;",8,
1116,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Before Vyvance I had tried many other medications. It helped me quickly, I realized that I actually liked school and learning. Within weeks I went from failing to honors. But now that I'm older I realize that it alters my personality and my mood alot. And I find that when I dont have it I tend to feel like I am incapable of completing simple task.;",8,
1117,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 5 and have been on Ritalin and Adderall throughout my entire life since then. I know long time. I was switched to Vyvanse and this is my first day taking it and I like it so far. I wouldn't call it a """"miracle drug"""" for me because I have extreme ADHD but it is a lot smoother than Adderall XR I was taking prior. I also feel more emotionally stable and have more confidence. I also take another 10 mg of Adderall around noon and another 20mg. We will see how this medicine holds up to all this good stuff. I am hoping forever since I will never be able to get off a stimulant medication. But remember, if you have been on stimulants for awhile and do not take them, you will feel EXTREMELY tired and sleep all day.;",8,
1118,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I had my college finals coming up and I couldn't get myself to concentrate so I got my doctor to prescribe it for me. I was able to concentrate but the thing is, I have a lot of anxiety, and by taking these pills, it just makes everything much worse. I got really anxious and upset at the end of each exam, even if I knew I did well. I never had this type of behaviour before taking the pills.;",8,
1119,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I started taking Vyvanse about 2 weeks ago. I am 14 years old I have noticed a huge difference and school and my grades have good from d's and f's to a's and b's. I LOVE YOU VYVANSE;,8,
1120,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I'm 25 years old and was diagnosed with ADD when I was about 8 years old and also have a processing problem as well. This is the 2nd day I am on it and on 20mg (lowest dose). It takes a little while to kick in but when it does I do get a little jittery (which is a side effect); which only lasts a few minutes. I concentrate so much better with my online courses. when I was first diagnosed with ADD I was put on a medication that my mother said I wasn't the same person anymore and since then I was never medicated and struggled with the simplest things and also became depressed. If you have been diagnosed with ADHD/ADD I do suggest this for you and helps; with this med you aren't a zombie or foggy.;,8,
1121,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My 12 years old son started Vyvanse 30mg more than one month ago. He is happy with the result in school. But what bothers me is he is kind of in slow motion especially in school (the teachers reported that).;,8,
1122,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 43 female ADHD, tried other medications, hated the up and down jittery feelings. Started Vyvanse 30mg 6 months ago, moved to 70mg now. This medication has helped me achieve major improvements in my concentration & focus. Only downsides are dry mouth & it does not hold me through the 12 hour time stated. I get about 8 hrs. My daughters started Vyvanse 50. My 15yr olds grades are up & my 20 yr old said, If this is how normal people focus and think, I'm jealous. OVERALL A WONDERFUL HELP :);",8,
1123,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I've been really pleased with the way vyvanse has helped me. On Vyvanse I'm not moody or lifeless like I had been on other drugs. My appetite is still very small and this is kind of a problem because I'm really light anyways. However, if I eat before I take it and snack on healthy things during school hours I don't crash when it wears off. With Vyvanse I've realized it's possible to control my ADD and keep my personality! I was VERY nervous about starting a new drug, but Vyvanse is really the best thing I've tried and my grades in my AP classes are better than they have ever been.;",8,
1124,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 18, and alongside my ADD, I suffer from major depression disorder, objective defiant disorder, and major case anxiety. After an emotional breakdown on a school trip, my doctor started me back on my Zoloft and once I got that stabilized he started me on Vyvanse. We started at 40 and that worked while I was taking my Zoloft at night, but when I moved it to the morning, we had to up the dose to 60mg. I have experienced nausea, dizziness, increasing perspiration, and a little insomnia, but they don't last too long. I have also been struggling with weight pretty much my whole life. I started on May 2nd and I have lost a little over 20lbs.;",8,
1125,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I started taking Vyvanse 2 weeks ago and it has helped with my focus, patience, anxiety and depression. My doctor tells me I have a mix of ADD/ADHD so he prescribed me on 50mg. I am worried though about all of these side effects I have been hearing about that could happen. The only side effects I have gotten is bruising easily and loss of appetite in which i force myself to eat because I end up feeling like I will pass out. Other than that I highly recommend vyvanse!;",8,
1126,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I am a 32 year old. I have been on Vyvanse for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I have never been diagnosed with ADD and about 2 months ago I was given Straterra first. I hated that. My Doctor switched me to 30mg Vyvanse and the first day I noticed a difference. It lasted me about 10-12 hrs. My appetite went down a little but nothing to bad. Other than that there are no other side effects for me. I would definitely recommend Vyvanse.;,8,
1127,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 33 years old, and my son is 7 years old and we both have ADD and ADHD respectively. His mom started him off with 20mg of Vyvanse and it seemed to help out his behavior and focus problems at school. The only thing is the poor kid is losing weight. I was curious about the side effects and wanted to see if it could help out with my focus. So I started taking Vyvanse as well. It has been okay. I like the fact that I can stay on task and not go from idea to idea and not stick to one thing, but there are major withdrawal symptoms and I tend to be a total space cadet if I don't take it.;",8,
1128,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 46 y.o. female and have been taking Vyvanse for approximately 3 months. I started out on 50mg in the morning and it worked great by giving me energy and completing projects. However, I would get tired after 8 hours. After 1 month of taking 50mg x1 a day my doctor switched me to 30mg twice daily to prevent that tired feeling after 8 hours. After 2 months of taking 30mg x2 a day I'm tired a lot and seemed to have already built up a resistance to it. Maybe I just need to increase the dose, not sure. This medicine worked great at first for ADHD and I'm hoping I can increase the dose and feel energetic and focused again. The side effects I have experienced are, weight loss (13lbs) the first month but gained 8 lbs back, and have bad breath.;",7,
1129,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was previously on Adderall XR before going on Vyvanse. My reason for switching was because I suffer from BED as well, which this drug is basically a miracle drug for. As far as how this drug functions as an ADHD med, I do not think it is as effective as Adderall but it does last for a really long time, which has its pro's and con's. If you take it too late, you will have a hard time sleeping and if you want to go to happy hour or grab a drink that day, because this drug takes anywhere from 9-11 hours to leave your system, you won't be able to feel the effects of alcohol or the effects of the alcohol will all kick in at once Vyvanse leaves your system (be warned). But if you want to get a lot done during the day, its good.;",7,
1130,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I've started taking Vyvanse about a year ago and for the first six months it was fantastic, I could concentrate and my grades were stellar. I was noticing some depression and random bouts of anger, but I just shrugged it off because it had been a rough school year. However, around September 2010 I ran out and the doctor couldn't see me until december (I know, it's crazy). Of course, I couldn't concentrate as well but my mood improved considerably, I was actually happy. I started taking it again in January and on the second day, I saw an ex-girlfriend that I still really liked and I almost broke down in tears. The drug does it's job, but for my personal experience it has played with my emotions. ;",7,
1131,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 33 yr old male, I started taking Vyvanse yesterday and it is the first medication that I have ever taken for anything really. I was B student in school because I refused to do homework, I couldn't concentrate enough to motivate myself to do it and I suffered in college for it. Now I manage restaurants. I am happy with that choice but lately as pressures from work seemed to increase, I chose to see a psychiatrist to help me complete tasks. I am taking 50mg a day, I usually wait until noon to dose since I work until 1 am most nights. So far, so good, a little jittery but it is new to my system. Slight loss of appetite but nothing that concerns me. I am happy with my choice so far.;",7,
1132,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I would have to agree that Vyvanse has helped extremely with my Adult ADHD and Social Phobia. It is a lot smoother than Adderall XR and doesn't upset my stomach like Concerta used to do. I also take it with Lexapro for my generalized anxiety disorder and have yet to experience any contraindications.;,7,
1133,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 20 year old female who started taking Vyvanse about a year ago. I take two 70s every morning and I still end up feeling exhausted around 9 every night. I'm pretty sure I'm heavily bipolar though and that my family isn't listening to me causing me to frankly, lose my mind. I end up skipping a lot of pills and that seems to help. Those days I feel comfortably idle.;",7,
1134,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 20 year old college student and I've been on Vyvanse 30 mg for a year and a half. When I first started taking Vyvanse it was amazing but it's effects have become very mild at this point. I probably need to get my doctor to bump up my dose. If I take a week off or don't take it as frequently I get much better results. Overall, I feel in complete control when I take it and my confidence is very high. However, sometimes when I'm on it I experience feelings of extreme worry about the future; these feelings are always very brief though and don't infringe on my well-being at all.;",7,
1135,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I've been taking Vyvanse for about a year now and it has been an interesting trip. At first I couldn't sleep for the life of me and would go days on only a couple hours of sleep that I could get. Then after a couple months I was able to sleep almost like I used to and I noticed that I was more mentally alert and energetic but, my appetite dramatically diminished to almost nothing and still felt like my body wasn't getting enough rest. On top of that, when I would skip a dose I would have EXTREME hunger where I couldn't eat enough and I would have terrible fatigue! After a year everything evened out and began to feel normal other than having no appetite, but I have a healthy food schedule so I don't forget to eat. I would also like to say that I think it should NOT be recommended for children!;",7,
1136,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 27 y.o. male. My doctor started me on a Focalin XR 20 mg regimen a month ago to treat my ADD and hopefully control my anxiety at the same time. I loved the Focalin for the first week or so that I was on. I could immediately tell a huge difference in my mood, concentration, focus and general outlook on life. My anxiety was decreased tremendously as well. As the month went on I started to notice that the Focalin was very hot and cold. Some days I would feel on top of the world and other days it didn't seem to work at all. My irritability increased too, so my doctor has switched me to Vyvanse 40 mg. This is my first day on it and no complaints so far.;",7,
1137,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 19, and I'm now 23. I have a """"severe"""" case as my psychologist & therapist would say in the 1 visit I met with them. I started out on Adderall and Adderall XR, but had to stop taking it due to the side effects like mood swings and Parkinson's like shaking in my hands. So my dr changed my meds to Vyvanse. I've been taking it for 1 yr and I no longer have mood swings or shake which is awesome because I don't think someone would like a shaking dental hygienist. I like Vyvanse because it still helps me concentrate, stay organized, and remember things that are told to me, but it wears off quickly. That is my only dislike about Vyvanse.;",7,
1138,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I started this pill at the beginning of the school year and it definitely helped me with school. At first I was and still am a considerably shy teen than my classmates. I don't know if it's the pill but I felt very socially detached but not as much now. Another thing is I used to be at least 13 pounds heavier but after taking this pill I've lost all my extra weight.;,7,
1139,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 16 yr old female and was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6. I was on Ritalin, then something else, then Concerta and it was hard. I had major depression, lack of sleep, lack of appetite and the ability to feel any emotion was gone. Yes I'm an A student but I was not happy, so I tried Vyvance. It doesn't last as long but I am happier. I can feel emotion now and I'm still getting A's and B's.;",7,
1140,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I've been on Vyvanse for about 2 months now and I've seen a huge improvement in my motivation to do thinks and want to do school work. My grades were really bad before I took Vyvanse but now they are excellent. The only downfall to this is I have lost about 20 pounds and it seems like I'm always nervous so I guess I'm going to stop this medicine so I can gain the weight back on.;,7,
1141,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 17 and on 60 mg of Vyvanse. I weigh about 112 lbs. I don't know if it's too high a dose, but ever since I got it increased from 50 to 60mg. I've been feeling actually tired, which is a surprise to me because it's a stimulant. I've also had more intense dizziness and headaches, and I had heart palpitations on the 50, but now they're more frequent, and chest pain, heart races, but I'm able to focus a little better.;",7,
1142,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My 9 year old daughter has been on this for about 2 months. We switched from Adderall XR due to severe weight loss. This seems to work much better and also does not affect her personality like Adderall. She has some loss of appetite but not as bad. Yesterday I forgot to give the medication to her and she had a severe crying spell last night and did not know why. I believe she may have been experiencing withdrawal symptoms. She is taking 40 mg. I may switch back to 30mg. Be aware that you may not be able to stop this medication abruptly if on it for a long time.;,7,
1143,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I've been almost 3 years taking 30mg. Initially, it was sporadical. Now I just need it daily to function properly. Until one year ago I took Lexapro 10 mg Xanax 1 or 2 mg/day. Now I had to increase Xanax to 4mg per day and sometimes Rohypnol to try to get some sleep. I feel really depressed and it's getting worse, also easily angry, that didn't occur when I took Lexapro but my psychiatrist didn't think it was necessary to take it any longer. I have to make major efforts to overcome suicidal thoughts. Have awful tremors and recently a unusual chest pain.;",7,
1144,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I loved the intended effects of Vyvanse, as it worked better than anything else I've tried. However, I was not able to tolerate the stomach-related side effects. I still want to try it again once other problems with my stomach are resolved, to see if I can tolerate it then.;",7,
1145,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Works better than Concerta for ADHD-IA for attentiveness as well as alertness. Far superior to Concerta in regards to affecting sleep. Vyvanse doesn't keep you awake. Also seems to contrast greatly to Concerta's method of dealing with attentiveness. Makes a less """"zombie-like"""" state of concentration and lets you break task when needed. An added effect is that of a more positive sense of well-being; most likely attributed to its amphetamine-based nature. The greatest advantage is the delayed release into the body. Great for those whose metabolisms don't react well to Adderall XR or Concerta. Only wished it lasted about two hours longer in the body, but adapting dose time is acceptable.;",7,
1146,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Vyvanse has worked wonders for me. It doesn't have the crash that other ADHD medications gave me and still keeps my attention up. ;,7,
1147,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,It works but I am taking low dose because it decreases appetite.;,7,
1148,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Cannot get to sleep. Extremely angry / irritated when first get up.;,7,
1149,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 11 year old daughter started Vyvanse 5 months ago when she was diagnosed with ADHD. Her doctor keeps increasing her dosage-we've gone from 20 to 40 mg, but I am not really seeing a difference. Her appetite has dropped, but we find that feeding her well in the mornings and evenings has helped. She is having problems with friends at school and we have noticed that she is incredibly bossy. She has been argumentative with everyone around her lately..;",7,
1150,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 20 years old and have been taking 60mg Vyvanse for a little more than 4 years now and It really helps me focus. It increases my attention span, clarity, and motivation without giving me jitters. However, I have experienced almost every side effect that comes with this medicine including insomnia, appetite loss, night time depression, flat-lined emotions throughout the day, ect. However, despite what you might think, there are ways around these bad side effects. Staying healthy is KEY. Making sure your keeping yourself hydrated and getting a good hour of exercise everyday can greatly reduce some of these bad side effects, and also hanging out with friends regularly helps too. This is just my experience though.;",7,
1151,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 20 year old college student who was working full time when I started taking this medicine, Vyvanse. At the time when I was first given this medicine I was about 140lbs and I'm 5'7"""". And after about 4 months of taking the Vyvanse I weighed anywhere between 115-120lbs. Not good! The medicine made me totally not eat and run around like I was on drugs and couldn't sit still. I became so skinny I could see all of my ribs. I also felt like I had lost all emotions and the relationship with my parents were harmed because of this. I think part of the problem was the doctor just upping my dose whenever he felt like it and not being very responsible. But I just want to warn anyone who is thinking about taking Vyvanse to be careful and have a doctor who cares.;",7,
1152,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 59 year old man. I have taken Adderall 30 mg. 3x daily for about 4 years. I am very happy with its performance; it has changed my life. It's hard for me to imagine all those years of struggling I went through before I was properly diagnosed. I tried Vyvanse 70 mg. for one week. Although it worked in a fashion similar to Adderall, I feel as if I have better control taking the medicine 3 x a day. The Vyvanse would wear off and then come back and start to work again and I found it disconcerting; it was like a roller coaster. With Adderall, I can expect it will begin to wear off after 4-5 hours and I simply take another one, usually before it has lost its effectiveness, and I feel the same all day.;",7,
1153,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 21 years old and I've been on 40mg Vyvanse for about 5 months give or take. I've been on other medications for ADHD in the past, but they left me feeling edge-y or more anxious. This medication works much better in terms of even release and feeling normal, and not jittery or like I have a come down when medication wears off. However, I still struggle trying to find the ideal medication/dosage because my days are long, sometimes from 4am until 10pm at night, and no medication has lasted that long for me. I used to take Adderall twice daily, so that it would last me the entire day, but that left me feeling terrible. I fear if I up the dosage of Vyvanse to twice daily, I may start getting other side effects as well. ;",7,
1154,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Just upped the dose to 50mg, this medicine works good as far as getting things done and having energy, the first time I took it I was really concerned about my school work and helps me stay on task. The only bad thing about it, for a few minutes at different times of the day this medicine makes me feel like it's wearing off and I feel down or kind of worried then it goes away. So my """"happy"""" felling goes up and down throughout the day.;",7,
1155,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My experience on this drug started well but has dropped off and I'm looking for an alternative. The first couple of months I went from 20 mg in morning and another 20 in afternoon. I'm now at 70 and 40. My therapist rx'd Kapvay with it to help with irritability and quick reactions to situations. While it helped the combo was making my teeth feel like razor blades and I was getting abrasions on my tongue. I dropped the Kapvay and it has helped with the teeth but I'm now dealing with several cavities to get filled. Also having trouble issues with insomnia as I always feel like I need to be getting something done. Over the past couple of months I've probably had 5 instances in which I've gone close to 44 hours without sleep.;,7,
1156,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"It would be nice if everyone put the dosage in the message. There could be a correlation to the score and the age of the child. I have noticed age is usually there but if you were to list dosage, age, and sex - it would be great.;",7,
1157,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I've been taking Vyvanse for a couple of months and I've have learned that the first couple of weeks taking the medication is really the hardest when it comes to side effects. I suffered from dry mouth, loss of appetite, head aches, some but very few mood swings. As far as sleep, I crash at the end of the day which can be due to this medication. I am irritable every now and then, but before I was very frustrated with everyday activities. It gives me energy for the most part. I'm not shaky or nervous like I was on Adderall XR. I haven't lost a ton of weight on Vyvanse unlike Adderall which I lost 60 pounds on within 4 months. ;",7,
1158,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 29 years old and was diagnosed with ADD when I was about 11 years old. Since that time I've been on and off a variety of medications from Ritalin, Adderall, and most recently Vyvanse which I've been on for a year and am currently taking 70mg a day. It helps with my alertness and attentiveness, but I have some of the side effects like extremely dry mouth and little if any appetite. I am currently working during the day and take graduate classes at night and notice that the medication does not last the entire 12 hours, I've been taking it later in the day so that I'm able to concentrate in class. Since I began taking the medication I have seen an increase in acne, previously I had minor occasional breakouts.;",6,
1159,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 21 years old 5'7 and 115 lbs. and I am currently taking 20mg in the morning. I've only been taking the medicine for about two weeks but I've noticed a lot of changes. Positives: I'm getting my work done, staying motivated, I'm focused on the road when I'm driving now and I don't forget little details like I was before. Negatives: zero appetite- I have to force myself to eat, minor nausea, easily aggravated. It also altered my menstrual cycle. I am still yet to start my period but I've never been irregular- starting on the exact same days of each month since always. My mood has COMPLETELY changed in the 2 weeks. I'm severely depressed now and mildly suicidal. Can't tell if these side effects are worth it;",6,
1160,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 20 year old female. I have been taking 50mg Vyvanse for about 3 months or so. I started taking it during the summer and so my schedule of taking it was rather irregular which caused me to have insomnia and decrease my appetite. I have started school now and it works wonders. I am able to concentrate in class and I have motivation to actually do my homework. I even wish I were in school longer..strange I know. I have experienced the side effects from it, more recently though. I have noticed my heart will race for no real reason, I have become more irritable and on edge (although I'm pretty sure I was like that before), and I tend to get kind of agitated at very minuscule things.;",6,
1161,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 24 year old male. I was on Adderall XR 30mg (daily) for around 3-4 years before my Doctor suggested we try Vyvanse. I have always been pleased with Adderall XR and have no complaints about side effects. Vvyanse (60mg daily) worked as advertised for a about 3-4 days. It was like an upgraded Adderall XR (provided a longer half life that is much needed for my schedule of college and work). Unfortunately, the drug drastically lost its effectiveness. The dry mouth was extreme as well. After just 10 days taking 2 at a time had no effect. Went back to adderall xr and I'm still impressed.;",6,
1162,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My 7 year old son started Vyvanse about 3 weeks ago. The first day he took a 30 mg dose which made him like a zombie all day and absolutely manic all night. He literally stayed up all night and ran up and down the hall and talked incessantly. At the end of my rope at 7 am I paged his doctor. We lowered the dose to 15 mg. He seemed initially to do better on the 15mg and was doing well in school. He became more aggressive and started having OCD behaviors of constantly washing his hands (I counted 30 times in an hour) and crying and staying up all night. Last night he stayed up until 4:30 am and I was at my wits end. So today his doctor is switching him to another medication but we may try it in a combination.;,6,
1163,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 9 y/o daughter was taking this. Started on a 30 MG dose then we kept moving up to 50. The 50 only seemed to make her aggressive at home with her sister and acting odd. Her school also commented that she has not change AT ALL even with the increase in dosage. This is the first ADD medication we have taken so maybe its not the one for her but, frustrating never the less.;",6,
1164,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 17 and have been taking this since 8th grade. I was diagnosed because I would get into trouble all the time and when I first started taking it, it was great. I stopped getting into trouble and so on. Now, 4 years later I feel it is completely different. Rapid heart rate, anger, don't care mood, dizziness, but it still makes me focused. I'm tying to get off it, but making slow progression because I'm really ADHD, my friends concur. The crash after taking it for so long feels like dementia. I only take it on weekdays and could relate to insomnia because I getless than 30 hours of sleep a week. ;",6,
1165,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have gone through alot of medications so far and I am completely frustrated with the extended release medications. I was so happy to start my son on Vyvanse because of the advertisement stating it last for 12 hours. Not so, it last probably 5 hours, why take extended medication if you have to give an afternoon dose? He has been on up to 70 mg of Vyvanse for a year now and I am thinking of switching him to a different medication. Vyvanse does take care of his hyperactivity but, the lack of attention and defiance is still there. Also, the medication takes 90 minutes to kick in. The doctor told me to give him a booster dose (10 mg. of Adderall) with the Vyvanse to kick in earlier, does not work. ;",6,
1166,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 6 yr old son has been on 20mg of Vyvanse for the past month and a half. I was so reluctant to start him on any type of medicine, but his inability to focus, keep his hands to himself, stay in his seat at school, etc., was affecting the learning of his classmates and causing him to have a hard time making friends. I saw a difference in him (and his teacher did, too), immediately after the 1st dose, he was able to focus, was making friends, etc. I have decided to try him on something different because he's losing weight and he's not the happy, sweet boy that I know he is. He's moody, he gets upset extremely easily, he's grumpy, and is SUPER serious about everything, he finds nothing funny. Its definitely altered his personality, even off the meds.;",6,
1167,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"It works, very well in fact, but I am getting really annoying side effects. Dry mouth, stomach pains, on the first day I take it, after it completely gets out of my system, I usually get headaches. I also barely eat, instead of eating about 3 steaks, I can only eat half a steak. Most peoples' side effects aren't as bad as mine, though.;",6,
1168,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Horrible effects on teeth. My teeth are literally falling out and disentergrating! I am scheduled to have full mouth implants.;,6,
1169,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I was originally on Concerta for my ADD and got extremely depressed and almost suicidal. I then switched to Adderall which I took for 4 years without many problems, until I developed a tolerance to it and my dose got so high that I was getting a bunch of side effects. I tried Strattera, which I did absolutely nothing and made me really sleepy. Then I switched to Vyvanse which worked about the same as the Adderall but I wasn't as irritable and didn't have the same loss of appetite. However, I did start to develop acne, which I didn't realize until recently was being caused by the Vyvanse. I've also developed a major dependency, if I don't take it, I have trouble doing daily tasks and I'm really tired.;",6,
1170,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 6 year old son was diagnosed with ADHD and started on Vyvanse 4 weeks ago. He has made HUGE strides in school. His teachers and I are all very impressed with what this medication has done for him academically. However, he has become an emotional wreck. If he isn't on auto-pilot or mentally checked out, he is snapping and yelling at people at the drop of a hat. He zones out, acts and appears to be """"high"""" .. a shell of him himself. It breaks my heart to see my fun loving, humorous vibrant little boy become a drone so that he can be successful at school. He is on the lowest dose of 20mg.;",6,
1171,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 19 and I started taking 100mg Vyvanse a day when I was 17. Before Vyvanse I took Focalin. I love Vyvanse except for the fact that it doesnt last for the full 12 hours. When I first started on it, my senior year in high school after I had my daughter. I had never felt so confident. I made high honors and was like smart for the first time. I was capable of being focused of what was only going on in the classroom and didn't have to worry about anything besides school. I just really hated when I would crash because then I would get tired and then didn't feel like really doing anything. I do notice side effects but other then that I think it's worth taking.;",5,
1172,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My kids do great in school, but on weekends I do not give the Vyvanse to them, they just sit and stare at the walls.;",5,
1173,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine," Good. Concentration, happy, easy to talk to Bad: ECG showed it was bad for my heart, had to stop. Anxiety, afraid and didn't know why. Although it made me happy it felt fake and like I was a prisoner in my mind just pleasing others. I won't take it to please others. Meds basically free in my country after reaching over $300 cause third highest tax paying country in the world.;",5,
1174,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I have a 16yr old son who was put on Vyvanse for his ADHD 3yrs ago. It worked good for awhile made better grades in school. He had less impulsivity and was able to focus more. He had decreased appetite and needed to be put on another medicine to help him sleep. In the past year his grades went down. He was already on the highest dose of 70mg. He was becoming aggressive and very hateful. I found out that he was smoking weed and drinking. He told me he felt so jittery from his Vyvanse that was the only way he could relax. I put my son in a rehab and they switched him to Strattera and he is doing a lot better.;,5,
1175,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 7 yr old daughter just started taking Vyvnase 40mg in the morning after 7 yrs of avoiding medications, she has completely slowed down and is able to focus. My only concern is her having dry mouth and biting on the inside of her jaw, this is her first day hopefully it just needs a few days to adjust. BIG difference already. I hope this is all we need and it continues to get better.;",5,
1176,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"After two hours of taking this at 60 mg, I feel NOTHING! I have never been on any other ADHD meds except this one. I've only been prescribed this medication two months ago and doc told me to take it once a day, everyday. I never abused it and never will. I am an avid runner and I run 3 to 5 miles everyday ever since I was 16, now I am 30 years old. I am also a serious health conscious person. I know that this drug is to be metabolized in your liver before becoming active but I feel like this medication goes through me too fast, like drinking water! I get more benefits for my cognition problems with Brintellix! This might be one of those cases where I might be better on Adderral. I never experienced a crash on this drug.;",5,
1177,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I started Vyvanse at 15 after a 2 year run on Concerta which I hated. When I started Vyvanse I was 5'8 150lbs. I started on the 30 mg dose and within a year was down to 132 pounds. The medicine works like a charm but makes it near impossible for me to eat.;,5,
1178,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My experience was one of """"thank goodness"""" until 17 days after. Now I am VERY irratable with little or no patience. I am seeing my doctor today for an update and will ask him to let me try (again) Dexedrine. I did not want to go off of it but I think because Vyvanse is new, well you can fill in the rest. The Dexedrine has been around for a long time and I feel it is above and beyond others with knowing what to expect all the time. Good luck to all of you. God Bless.;",5,
1179,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am a 19 year old college student and just got prescribed Vyvanse about 2 days ago. When I take it I mainly feel relaxed and sometimes excited. I've never been on any stimulant or ADD medication before. My main concern is losing weight on this medicine. I'm about 5'9"""" and weigh about 135lbs. I eat a lot and I'm still fairly skinny. I've always worried about my weight and the last thing I want is to get skinnier. ;",5,
1180,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son was on Vyvanse for 3 years. At first the side effects were the normal irritability, obsessive thoughts and anxiety only on the days he took the drug. His concentration and grades improved so the benefits outweighed the side effects. The last year though he was increasingly negative, obsessing over negative thoughts, anxious and paranoid only on the days he took it. I think the side effects can affect kids more or less as they grow. He was very depressed for a 10 year old. Since he's been off he's been happier!! I think positive thoughts are more important than grades since we all know where negative thoughts leads to down the road if left unchecked. Overall the medicine is not bad but keep a close eye on behavior.;",5,
1181,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 17 years old, I've always had a problem focusing in school. Eventually I was taken to get tested and I did in fact have A.D.D . My doctor started me on 50mg of Vyvanse. My first day taking the pill was amazing and so was that whole 2 weeks. Its now my third week on Vyvanse and I've been having rapid heart rates, blurred vision, and feeling very jittery/shaky. I'm curious if my dosage is too high for me. I'm also afraid that if I get my dosage lower that it will no longer work for me. ;",5,
1182,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I been taking Vyvanse a little over 2 yrs. This is the only medicine I have taken for ADHD. As of this posting I have been off it 3 days. The first 18 months I thought Vyvanse was the best thing sense sliced bread. The last 6 mths have been an emotional roller coaster of side effects. I have spent hours on the floor crying, my social life is none, I didn't talk to anyone but the people at work that I couldn't avoid, my husband wants a divorce and nothing made me happy, I was sad and depressed all the time. Please be careful taking this medicine. I don't think it was meant for long term use or maybe it just affects different people in different ways. After 3 days in bed I'm finally getting back to normal.;",5,
1183,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My son is 13 and has been on several ADHD medications. I liked the Vyvance at first because I did see an improvement in his ability to sit and listen and pay attention, however it didn't last long enough. The doctor has increased the dosage several time and now he is up to 60mg daily. The problem is that he has lost over 20lbs because he simply won't eat and now it seems after four months on this medicine its like his body has adapted to it and he is super hyper. I spoke to the doctor about it and he said he can do real damage at his age with the weight loss and not eating and that the stimulant is actually wiring him up. We are going to take him off of the Vyvanse and put him on a non stimulant medication.;",5,
1184,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am fifteen years old and started taking Vyvanse 30 mg dose in October. I moved to 50mg and am now at 70mg. At the lower dose I noticed definite improvement in my attention span and work ethic. On the 70mg I feel anxious, depressed, and I have headaches constantly. I feel like isolating myself socially from everyone else and am extremely moody. I do not recommend more than 50mg of this medication to anyone.;",5,
1185,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I started this medication yesterday. 1st day was great, I felt alert and motivated. On the 2nd day, I could not focus very well, once I realized I can't focus I started getting stressed and then out of no where I felt great sadness come over me and cried for two hours. This medication clearly altered my emotional state. Pros- lasts throughout the day, does suppress appetite for those of us looking to shed few pounds.;",5,
1186,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I started taking this medicine about 2 years ago now. I am on the 40 mg dose and at first everything was great, my grades improved, I could focus in public. But now, my loss of appetite is crazy. I'm 13 and I only weigh 82 lbs. I become very short tempered with my friends and I get annoyed at the littlest things. It also brings my mood way down. When I'm on my medicine I feel depressed and anxious constantly. I still get my a's and b's in school but I don't think it's worth all the side affects.;",4,
1187,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I started out with 50 mg and then went to 70mg. My blood pressure skyrocketed and I have always had low blood pressure. My doctor took me off of this immediately. ;,4,
1188,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 6 yr old son just starting taking the medicine a week ago and has been over the top emotional, a lot of crying over nothing at his daycare during the day. He started at 10mg which did nothing but makes him cry so he went to 20mg for 3 days which seemed to work for about 2 days. Today we put him up to 30mg to see how it goes. I'm worried about the emotional side effects and really hope that it subsides.;",4,
1189,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Vyvanse didn't work for me. I had to switch back to Adderall XR. Vyvanse had no effect on my mood or concentration levels at all.;,4,
1190,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 20 years old and I have ADD. I have been on every medication under the sun. I've been on the lower dose of Vyvanse for about a year and 1 week on the 40 mg. It has turned me into a monster. Side effects, I have been temperamental, irritated, easily annoyed. Mean to people close to me for no reason. Tired of school, want to give up school, dizzy. Feel like on autopilot going through the motions not really there, don%u2019t care anymore, isolation. My eye sight has been whack since I started higher dose. Have had chest pain not often every once in a while. I am happy during the day but at night. ;",4,
1191,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 8 year old son has been on this mediation for 1 year and a half. He started at 20mg now he is taking 40mg. I have noticed that it does not seem to work and after trying for 9 months to get him off and on something else I am going to take him to a different doctor. Given the fact that after 9 months it is still not working another doctor would try something different but his Doctor just keeps upping the dosage. I have also noticed side effects that disturb. It worries me because my son is usually happy go lucky all the time and with this medicine he is VERY EASILY upset, not himself at all. SO PLEASE BE AWARE OF EVERYTHING YOUR CHILD DOES OR ACTS WHILE TAKING THIS MEDICATION.;",4,
1192,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 7 year old son has been on Vyvanse for a little over a month. We have been well pleased with the overall outcome. He is now able to focus in school and actually sits down and completes his homework without argument. Much calmer in public, unlike before. Downside, he has lost 4 pounds in a month and becomes very emotional if taken off for the weekend and put back on. After 1 1/2 months, my son now has developed eye tics. We have stopped the medication and the eye tics are beginning to subside.;",4,
1193,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Been taking the drug for 2 weeks. The dosage is 70. I have adult ADHD. The side effects I am experiencing are a slight head ache during sleep and I am experiencing insomnia. Probably need to check my blood pressure more often. I am not all that happy with current results.;,4,
1194,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"There are many positives such as motivation, and a brief period of content, but there are also many negatives.. rapid heartbeat/chest pains, weight loss, dizziness, dry mouth. When the medicine kicks in, i feel this amazing sense of being content.., no matter what I'm doing at the time i just feel happy, but soon feel an extreme sadness and despair when it wears off, because i wonder why i can't be happy anymore. I also become extremely irritable, anxious, and restless. I continue to take this medication ,because it helps me get things done and focus, but the negative impact is extremely hard on me, and effects my mental and physical health greatly. Most common side effects for me are chest pains, sadness, rapid mood change, headache, and loss;",4,
1195,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My daughter is 6 years old and was diagnosed with ADHD when she was 4. I just recently put her on medication due to the fact her grades were slipping and she was in trouble constantly at school. She is on 30mg of Vyvanse. Although she has improved 100% at school she comes down off the medication at about 5pm and is a holy terror. She gets put to bed at 8 and does not fall asleep until some time around midnight. Also she does not eat hardly anything but she has always been that way for the most part.;,4,
1196,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I had taken Adderal for years. 90mg daily. It was suggested by my psychiatrist to start taking the Vyvanse. I have really noticed a decrease in my energy level, and sometimes I struggle with motivation issues. I take 70mg daily. I sometimes have to check to make sure that I did remember to take it that day.;",3,
1197,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I started Vyvanse about 5 months ago. My doctor first had me on Focalin which helped, but didn't seem to get me all the way there. Since I have generalized anxiety disorder he started with Focalin. He said Focalin was a gentler medication. After about 2 weeks he started Vyvanse at 20mg. I really started to like the medication: more focus, motivation. I have worked my way up to 50mg. After a couple of weeks on each dose, the medication doesn't last the whole 12 hours. I do really like the medication. I just hope that I don't have to keep going up with the dosage.;",3,
1198,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I've been taking Vyvanse for about 2 years. It DOES help me concentrate in school, but the concentration comes at a cost. I feel zombie-fied and extremely anxious, even jittery at times but I don't feel hyper. Vyvanse also makes me feel really cold all the time.;",3,
1199,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 15 year old son stated taking a 50mg dose of Vyvanse last spring. We were elated with the initial response. His attitude and outlook improved greatly, and performance at school improved. His appetite dropped off too. After 6 weeks of taking daily doses he began vomiting. We ended up taking him off this medication because of the vomiting. ;",3,
1200,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I have been on this med for 12 days, so far i haven't seen a difference, in fact I'm thinking my Dr gave me a placebo. I have been very tired and sleeping more. I have tried Dexedrine and Concerta which I feel, worked better, but was harsh. I hope in time I will see the benefits.;",3,
1201,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 49 and I've been taking Vyvanse for three years. It does help somewhat, but it only last about five to six hours, probably less than that. I'm taking 20mg, which I think is too low, but my provider refuses to raise the dosage.;",3,
1202,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My daughter just turned 7 years old and we started her on Vyvanse about 2 months ago as she was diagnosed with ADHD. After two months (this week) I called the doctor and stopped the medication as she has lost so much weight from not eating, and was sleeping ALL THE TIME! My daughter never took naps and would wake up at 6:30 a.m. religiously every morning on her own, but after we started her on the medicine, she falls asleep standing up and cannot wake her up in the mornings. We fight just to get her to eat things she likes and to no prevail. I know it might not be the medicine for her and in fact I am going to try a Non-Stimulant ADHD medication before we stop these medicines over all. ;",3,

I'm not saying it doesn't work because I went from any average student to where B's are a disappointment to my mom. But I haven't had much of a social life anymore, the people at my lunch table think I'm anorexic and I don't sleep most nights. I get headaches constantly and I'm tired of this. I tried other medicines but my mom said nothing works as good. ;",3,
1205,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My daughter is 8 years old and have been taking medicines since she was almost 4. She has been on a lot of different medicines. I am just wondering if her sudden outburst of happy, sad violent behavior is due to the doctors increasing her Vyvanse from 20mg to start with 1 year ago to 70mg which is what she is taking today.;",3,
1206,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm a 24 year old female who was diagnosed with ADD last July. I've been on Ritalin, Adderall and now Vyvanse. I started off on Vyvanse 30 mg about a month ago. It didn't do a thing for me. My doctor upped my dosage to 50 mg a little over a week ago. Since then things haven't been too pretty. My mind is clear, which is great but I'm completely unmotivated to do anything. I don't want to clean. I don't want to leave my house. I don't want to do anything. I feel exhausted. I guess it's like a zombie like state that I wouldn't mind if I didn't have a child and a house to care for. I'm hoping my doctor will switch me to Adderall XR. I've always lacked energy and this definitely isn't helping.;",3,
1207,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 7 year old was placed on this for ADHD. Although it did wonders for his academic progress as if a light was instantly turned on. His personality changed. He went from occasional outbursts to full blown temper tantrums, hitting, swearing. Like he was posessed by the devil. He couldn't sleep for days. Needless to say he is off it. We are now trying foclain. Not as many emotional problems. But not as focused. We'll hopefully find the right one.;",3,
1208,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I'm 19 and had taken Concerta successfully since I was 14, but being in college I needed a medication that would last for longer than Concerta did. My symptoms have never been very bad, but definitely affected my work. My psychiatrist suggested Vyvanse, but it was hell. It worked about the same as Concerta, but it would wear off after about 6 hours, and I would collapse on the floor sobbing. Every night I would become extremely suicidal and angry, and after just a two weeks my relationships with everyone was at a breaking point. I went back to Concerta, and now take a small dose of Ritalin when it wears off. So much better.;",3,
1209,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My daughter is taking Vyvance and she is seeing people following her, she thinks her phone is being tapped and she believes there are people monitoring her entire behavior. This is a really freaky side effect! She has a predisposition for Mental disease.;",3,
1210,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My seven year old son is on it and he is so emotional. One minute he is fine the next he is crying and can't stop. As a mother this is very hard to deal with.

1211,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 5 yr old started taking Vyvanse today and had a bad reaction to it while at school, severe itching with a twitch of his shoulder. There was no outside signs of breakout. Tried to contact doctor who prescribed and have received no reply, therefore after talking to pharmacist and school nurse, and health unit care provider, I have decided to stop Vyvanse, 30mg daily, until I receive some reply from his doctor. Then I am going to ask for something else. If it works fine for your children, God bless, but please keep an eye on them for the first 24 hours; allergic reactions do occur, we were just lucky it was not more severe.;",3,
1212,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I used this medication during the last school year, but it didn't help me much. My grades were still failing and I had no appetite. I was also very depressed.

1213,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"While Vyvanse worked relatively well for my ADHD symptoms, it did not last nearly as long as advertised. It only lasted about seven hours at best.;",3,
1214,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Was placed on Vyvanse after extreme weight loss on Adderall. Started at 20mg, upped to 40mg, then upped to 40mg 2x a day. I got my appetite back, but the medication really did nothing else for me. I went into rages and had huge anger problems for no reason. Anything could set me off! I could barely sleep or focus at work/school. Basically, I gained back the weight I had lost, but everything else sucked. I couldn't make it more than 6 months, my doctor switched me to Adderall XR.;",2,
1215,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Worked great the first couple of days - concentrated, laser focus and able to work hard. A few days in, I felt like I was on speed - couldn't concentrate, thoughts racing, difficulty completing tasks. I couldn't stay on it, I was so anxious.;",2,
1216,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 6 yr old son started on an ADHD regimen about 8 months ago. We started on Concerta, increased dosage 3 different times, and switched to Vyvanase. We have increased it to 30 mg and it still is not working. However, now the moodiness, extreme sadness, and impulsiveness is much worse while on Vyvanse. I really am considering just dealing with the ADHD without medicinal help. I feel sorry for the little guy. This is not what I want him to be like.;",2,
1217,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 8yr old daughter has been on Vyvanse for almost 2yrs. She started on 20mg a day, she seemed to be doing better as far as focusing, but very emotional. Her doctor decided to up her dose to 30mg and now 40mg. The 40mg also seemed to help at school her grades went up and she was able to pay attention. I'm now noticing that my little girl is not the same person, she's has become rude, depressed, emotional, getting in trouble, suicidal and just out of control. Parents really should keep a journal of changing side effects they notice. Needless to say my daughter is no longer taking this medication and not yet found one to replace it.;",2,

I am a successful professional that always had to work a little harder to achieve results due to my lack of concentration and tendency toward distractions. I started taking Vyvanse, and have to admit I felt like Superwoman for about a week and ranted and raved about how much I was getting done without the jittery feeling most stimulants provide. But then all in one day, I crashed. I started getting extremely agitated. I then would get so angry I would cry hysterically. I quit taking the medication and within a few days my mood and attitude have leveled off. Although, I have suffered from extreme vertigo and exhaustion since I have been off this medicine. I was on 30mg.;",2,
1219,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 21 yrs old and work and am a full time nursing student. This medication has affected my personality. I am usually a bright bubbly person and don't take anything too personal. After a week of this medicine (40 mg) I noticed I'm snapping at people over absolutely nothing. I feel like I've become bipolar, one moment I'll be beyond happy and focused, the next irritated, then angry. Then crying over nothing. I've become mouthy to my instructors and don't like long conversations anymore. People seem to irritate me and there's only a few that I can stand being around for a long period of time. I've already made mean remarks to some of my fellow students, which isn't me at ALL. Maybe this medication isn't for everyone.;",2,
1220,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Not a good experience here. My 10 year old son was put on it. He started hallucinating, hearing voices, he was terrified. Uncontrollable crying. He couldn't be in a room alone. He was going into panic attacks because he was so scared. He didn't know why he was scared or why he couldn't stop crying.;",2,
1221,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"This medication ruined me. When I was in my freshman year of high school I could see no point in living. I started taking this in the second grade and now it has literally no effect. I was failing all of my classes and I gave up on trying to go to college, this drug makes you think their are two yous, the medicine """"normal"""" or the non medicated """"annoying"""". The only reason doctors give this to people is to get money, scheduling appointments every 3 months.;",1,
1222,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 7 year old son has ADHD. After years of struggling with ADHD as a parent I decided to finally try medication for my son he was prescribed Vyvanse. During the first month is was great he was finally able to focus in school and follow directions, I received so much positive feedback. Starting on the second month I noticed he was sad all the time at first I dismissed it as maybe he was having a rough day, than it became two weeks and it really effected his mood. My son starting to not care in school, he would cry for any minor thing, he lost a lot of weight and overall I thought he was depressed. I brought it up to his therapists who recommended we immediately remove him off of it.;",1,
1223,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Do not prescribe this to anyone !! This drug should not be legal. After 2 weeks it made me feel suicidal, which I've never been in my entire 33 yrs of being alive. It swung me into a severe depression and accumulated a huge amount of anxiety. This is the most unhealthy experience I have ever had. It ruined my relationship and my personality when I was taking it. I started a college class and the doctor prescribed this to me for concentration. It made me feel like I was on speed. When I stopped taking it about 6 days later I was a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT person, I was finally back to normal. Please watch your children or anyone you know who may be taking this.;",1,
1224,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,My son has been on this medication since September. I have taken him off. I didn't even recognize him his emotions were so high and the anger and aggression was unbelievable!;,1,
1225,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"5th month on Vyvanse 30 mg which is on the lower dose end. This med has an awful crash. I exercise 4-6x a week. I eat very healthy. I stay busy. I read so many reviews about the same issue. I did reading about the """"minimal"""" crash felt on this med and it is so scary how pharmaceutical companies try to set the med apart. For me it lasts 6 hrs and irritability increases. I think it's in-part tolerance. Mid afternoon, I get severely irritable, anxious, moody, sleepy, and agitated. It is so uncomfortable, I'm supposed to """"up"""" my dose now...to see it last longer and my """"crash"""" will start later""""? ;",1,
1226,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I took Vyvanse 50mg for about 4 months. As I started the medication everything was going great and I was focused. However, I was an emotional wreck while on it. People at work thought I was going crazy because I was angry at silly things, which is not my personality at all. Vyvanse seemed to work good in the mornings but wore off around 1pm. I took it around 7:30am. The medication really depends on what you eat. 12 hours is not true for me. I don't know about you but I don't have time to make sure I eat this type of food for dinner and this type for breakfast just so my my medicines will work. Some days the Vyvanse would not work at all and I didn't get anything done. Vyvanse also caused hair loss and turned grey. I'm 25 yrs old.;",1,
1227,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"Started on by vyvanse after I was diagnosed with ADD at an age of 19. I had been on Strattera to previously which worked well, but I was still a bit lathargic. The first few months were great, but as the doses started increasing I became delusional & physcotic. It go so bad at 40mg that I thought the mafia was coming to get me, but in reality it was just a car driving in front of my house. This drug ended up with me being sedated by the cops, and being placed in the psychiatric ward for a month. The withdrawals I got from this drug were horrible, I imagine it's what it's like to quit a harder recreational drug. I know this drug works great for some people, but not for everyone. I'd be vary cautious of vyvansae if you value your sanity.;",1,
1228,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DRUG! I like many of you really from what I have read had a great experience AT FIRST. I am 26 years old and do sales for a living. I was on cloud nine towards the beginning trail of this prescription. I was able to concentrate more than I had in months and was more motivated to go out and look for new leads for my company. I found that I would get dizzy or a tab nauseous but I found that staying hydrated and always having a water bottle with me helped out. I developed a problem where I would know what I wanted to say but when I went to speak it didn't come out right and literally made me sound like I was high or drunk. VERY SCARY!;,1,
1229,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,Did absolutely nothing for me. Even on the highest dose 70 mg. now taking Adderall 30 mg 2xday. Works only minimally. Now what.;,1,
1230,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"I am 55 years old and was diagnosed with ADD only last year. I changed from Adderall XR to Vyvanse and after 3 weeks, I am having anxiety and total lack of focus. It seems to make me more agitated and more easily distracted. There is definitely not a """"focus"""" benefit for me on this drug.;",1,
1231,Vyvanse,9,lisdexamfetamine,"My 6 yo son was only on this 10 days before yanking him off of it. The first day he ate almost nothing, threw up by 5pm and was awake at least 3 hours after putting him to bed. That day and the next few days he talked incessantly and had dry mouth, but his ability to attend in school was a little better but only for maybe 4 hours tops. By the last 3 days, it was making him worse. He was very irritable and was literally bouncing off the walls, and made his impulsiveness even worse. He was crawling on the floor, biting his nails wildly, licking things...you name it. This was a kid that most other people never even knew had issues, but within a week on Vyvanse, he was definitely acting wild.;",1,
